MKSC,2025,How Does Prepopulating Search Bars with Keywords Affect Online Consumer Behavior? A Field Experiment,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2024.0793,"Search aid technologies, especially prepopulated search bars, are increasingly being adopted by major players in the fast-growing e-commerce industry. Yet, surprisingly little is known about the impact of prepopulating search bars with keywords on online consumer journey. In this study, I design and run a randomized field experiment on a large e-commerce platform involving 72,587 consumers who were randomly exposed to three types of keywords prefilled in the search bar. Individual consumer–level analyses reveal that prepopulating trending category keywords encourages users to discover and buy items from the suggested category without reducing queries using self-entered keywords, ultimately leading to a 10.4% (8.8%) increase in purchase incidence (spending) compared with the counterfactual outcomes when the search bar is empty. Prepopulating personalized keywords brings about more focused product searching within the category recently browsed by users, resulting in a 21% (17%) increase in purchase incidence (spending), although this is offset by the negative effect of a reduction in queries using self-entered keywords. Exposure to niche category keywords is found to have little impact. This study also finds that a prepopulated search bar does not cannibalize the other navigation tool, making it a beneficial addition to the focal e-commerce platform’s business outcomes. These findings, contributing to the literature on consumer search and product recommendation strategies for digital platforms, carry timely implications for e-commerce managers.History:Catherine Tucker served as the senior editor.Supplemental Material:The online appendix and data files are available athttps://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2024.0793."
MKSC,2025,Consumer Response to Monetary Subsidies: A Structural Demand Analysis of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2021.0374,"There is growing debate about whether consumer subsidies related to nutrition programs should be more flexible. Additional flexibility increases consumer welfare but may hinder efforts toward achieving nutrition goals. We study how consumers would respond to subsidy designs with different spending restrictions. To simulate consumer behavior under different subsidies, we develop a direct utility model that integrates consumer decisions for brands, categories, and stores. This model is used to simulate consumer behavior for benefit designs that are not observed in practice but are often part of the policy debate. We apply the model to quantify the effects of supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) benefits relative to alternative subsidy designs. Our findings indicate that SNAP benefits can be effective in driving food purchases, although on average only 70% of the subsidy would get spent, and only half of that would lead to greater food spending. The latter is driven by sizable spillovers toward other categories not covered under the program. To quantify the consumer welfare implications associated with alternative subsidy designs, we find that, on average, consumers would be willing to trade $1.00 in SNAP benefits for $0.29 in unrestricted cash benefits because of the spending restrictions associated with food stamps.History:Avi Goldfarb served as the senior editor.Funding:A.

MKSC,2025,"Alone, Together: A Model of Social (Mis)Learning from Consumer Reviews",https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2023.0053,"We develop a dynamic model of naïve social learning from consumer reviews. In our model, consumers decide if and what to buy based on both the products’ expected quality and their idiosyncratic taste for them. Products’ qualities are initially unknown and are (mis)learned from reviews. At the heart of the model lies a dynamic feedback loop between reviews, beliefs, and choices: periodtreviews influence𝑡+1t+1consumers’ beliefs and, thus, choices; these determine the average of𝑡+1t+1reviews, which, in turn, influences𝑡+2t+2beliefs, choices, and reviews. We show that, in the long run (𝑡=∞t=∞), reviews are systematically biased, leading some consumers astray. In particular, in both monopoly and duopoly, reviews relatively advantage lower quality and more polarizing products because these products induce stronger taste-based consumer self-selection. Thus, in stark contrast with the winner-takes-all dynamics of classic observational learning models in which consumers learn from the choices of their predecessors, social learning from opinions generates excessive choice fragmentation. Our findings have implications for interpreting the variance and number of reviews, pricing in the presence of reviews, and the short- and long-term effectiveness of fake reviews.History:Anthony Dukes served as the senior editor.Supplemental Material:The online appendix is available athttps://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2023.0053."
MKSC,2025,"Personalization, Consumer Search, and Algorithmic Pricing",https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2023.0455,"Our study investigates the impact of product ranking systems on artificial intelligence (AI)-powered pricing algorithms. Specifically, we examine the effects of “personalized” and “unpersonalized” ranking systems on algorithmic pricing outcomes and consumer welfare. Our analysis reveals that personalized ranking systems, which rank products in decreasing order of consumer’s utilities, may encourage higher prices charged by pricing algorithms, especially when consumers search for products sequentially on a third-party platform. This is because personalized ranking significantly reduces the ranking-mediated price elasticity of demand and thus incentives to lower prices. Conversely, unpersonalized ranking systems lead to significantly lower prices and greater consumer welfare. These findings suggest that even in the absence of price discrimination, personalization may not necessarily benefit consumers because pricing algorithms can undermine consumer welfare through higher prices. Thus, our study highlights the crucial role of ranking systems in shaping algorithmic pricing behaviors and consumer welfare.History:Anthony Dukes served as the senior editor.Funding and Competing Interests:All authors certify that they have no affiliations with or involvement in any organization or entity with any financial interest or nonfinancial interest in the subject matter or materials discussed in this article.

MKSC,2025,Nonparametric Pricing Bandits Leveraging Informational Externalities to Learn the Demand Curve,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2022.0247,"We propose a novel theory-based approach to the reinforcement learning problem of maximizing profits when faced with an unknown demand curve. Our method, rooted in multiarmed bandits, balances exploration and exploitation across various prices (arms) to maximize rewards. Traditional Gaussian process bandits capture one informational externality in price experimentation—correlation of rewards through an underlying demand curve. We extend this framework by incorporating a second externality, monotonicity, into Gaussian process bandits by introducing monotonic versions of both the Gaussian process-upper confidence bound and Gaussian process-Thompson sampling algorithms. Through reduction of the demand space, this informational externality limits exploration and experimentation, outperforming benchmarks by enhancing profitability. Moreover, our approach can also complement methods such as partial identification. Additionally, we present algorithm variants that account for heteroscedastic noise in purchase data. We provide theoretical guarantees for our algorithm and empirically demonstrate its improved performance across a broad range of willingness-to-pay distributions (including discontinuous, time varying, and real world) and price sets. Notably, our algorithm increased profits, especially for distributions where the optimal price lies near the lower end of the considered price set. Across simulation settings, our algorithm consistently achieved over 95% of the optimal profits.History:Olivier Toubia served as the senior editor.Supplemental Material:The online appendix and data files are available athttps://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2022.0247."
MKSC,2025,"Choice Architecture, Privacy Valuations, and Selection Bias in Consumer Data",https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2023.0373,"How does choice architecture used during data collection influence the quality of collected data in terms of volume (how many people share) and representativeness (who shares data)? To answer this question, we run a large-scale choice experiment to elicit consumers’ valuation for their Facebook data while randomizing two common choice frames: default and price anchor. An opt-out default decreases valuations by 22% compared with opt-in, whereas a $0–$50 price anchor decreases valuations by 37% compared with a $50–$100 anchor. Moreover, some consumer segments are influenced by frames more while having lower average privacy valuations. As a result, conventional frame optimization practices that aim to maximize data volume can exacerbate bias and lower data quality. We demonstrate the magnitude of this volume-bias trade-off in our data and provide a framework to inform optimal choice architecture design.History:Catherine Tucker served as the senior editor.Funding:This research is funded by the Becker Friedman Institute at the University of Chicago and the Willard Graham Research Fund at Chicago Booth.

MKSC,2025,Time Dependence and Time Preference: Implications for Compensation Structure,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2022.0037,"This study jointly examines agents’ time dependence—period effects within instantaneous utility—and time preference—the behavior on discounting future utility. It considers the start- and end-of-period effects for time dependence and exponential and hyperbolic discounting for time preference. The study provides formal identification arguments and sufficient conditions for both time constructs, including the duration of time dependence. Using granular individual data and variations in the compensation structure, the empirical analysis separately identifies the two time constructs. Accounting for agents’ time assessment, counterfactual studies examine how changes in compensation structures affect agents’ behavior and, subsequently, their sales outcomes. The findings reveal a trade-off between long- and short-quota cycles, demonstrate the nonlinearity of sales performance relative to the duration of the compensation cycle, and show how quota-bonus plans and commissions can motivate different types of agents.History:Tat Chan served as the senior editor.Supplemental Material:The online appendix and data files are available athttps://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2022.0037."
MKSC,2025,Behavior-Based Pricing Under Informed Privacy Consent: Unraveling Autonomy Paradox,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2024.0867,"The implementation of recent privacy protection regulations mandates that firms obtain privacy consent from consumers before acquiring their private data. This procedure, known as “informed privacy consent,” has significant implications for behavior-based pricing, wherein firms engage in third-degree price discrimination based on consumers’ purchase history. Before keeping track of consumers’ purchasing history for implementing price discrimination, firms must seek consumers’ privacy consent, enabling consumers to autonomously make decisions regarding their data. These endogenous privacy decisions are shaped by several factors, such as the cost of risk from privacy breaches, anticipation of future utility changes driven by price discrimination and personalized products, and rewards for opting in. Although consumers strategically decide their privacy choices to get the best future utility, in equilibrium, none of them exclusively benefit from their choices, which leads to a decrease in overall consumer surplus even with the enhanced utility from personalized products and rewards for opting in. Firms, despite the cost of providing the rewards, earn higher profits by exploiting consumers’ strategic privacy decisions, which alleviates price competition. Our findings underscore an autonomy paradox that empowering consumers to make informed decisions about their privacy rights does not necessarily lead to increased consumer surplus. This result implies privacy regulations founded on informed consent may lead to unintended consequences.History:Olivier Toubia served as the senior editor.Funding:This work was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grants 72331011 and 72442010] and Institute for Research in Marketing (IRM) Research Funds.Supplemental Material:The online appendix is available athttps://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2024.0867."
MKSC,2025,Advertising Platforms and Privacy,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2024.0879,"We examine the implications of privacy-motivated targeting restrictions on consumer welfare, advertisers’ customer acquisition costs, and platform revenue. In our model, competitive product firms reach consumers by placing informative ads on a monopoly advertising platform; consumers are horizontally differentiated in their product preferences and in their willingness to pay for a less preferred product, but they don’t have any intrinsic privacy preferences or an aversion to mistargeted ads per se. In this context we show that both the platform and consumers would be better off without privacy restrictions if ad rates are exogenous to the privacy regime. However, in the more realistic scenario of endogenous ad rates, consumers with flexible product preferences are likely to be better off under privacy. This is because a platform with market power recognizes the threat cross-selling by mistargeted ads poses to ad volume and compensates by lowering ad rates. Flexible consumers benefit when competitive product firms pass on their advertising cost savings in the form of lower product prices.History:Anthony Dukes served as the senior editor.Funding:This work was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [Grants 435-2017-0121, 435-2020-0073].Supplemental Material:The online appendix is available athttps://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2024.0879."
MKSC,2025,Unequal Impact of Zestimate on the Housing Market,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2022.0451,"We study the impact of Zillow’s Zestimate on housing market outcomes and how the impact differs across socioeconomic segments. Zestimate is produced by a machine learning algorithm using large amounts of data and aims to predict a home’s market value at any time. Zestimate can potentially help market participants in the housing market as identifying the value of a home is a nontrivial task. However, inaccurate Zestimate could also lead to incorrect beliefs about property values and therefore, suboptimal decisions, which would hinder the selling process. Meanwhile, Zestimate tends to be systematically more accurate for rich neighborhoods than poor neighborhoods, raising concerns that the benefits of Zestimate may accrue largely to the rich, which could widen socioeconomic inequality. Using data on Zestimate and housing sales in the United States, we show that Zestimate overall benefits the housing market as on average, it increases both buyer surplus and seller profit. This is primarily because its uncertainty reduction effect allows sellers to be more patient and set higher reservation prices to wait for buyers who truly value the properties, which improves seller-buyer match quality. Moreover, Zestimate actually reduces socioeconomic inequality as our results reveal that both rich and poor neighborhoods benefit from Zestimate but that the poor neighborhoods benefit more. This is because poor neighborhoods face greater prior uncertainty and therefore, would benefit more from new signals.History:Tat Chan served as the senior editor.Supplemental Material:The online appendix and data files are available athttps://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2022.0451."
MKSC,2025,Bricks Processing Returns for Clicks: Can Foes Become Friends?,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2023.0077,"The rise of e-commerce has transformed the retail industry, changing consumer habits and forcing offline retailers to find new ways to stay relevant. Meanwhile, online retailers are seeking ways to enhance the flexibility of product returns as they lack a tactile shopping experience. As such, novel buy online, return in store (BORS) agreements between competing online and offline retailers, such as Amazon and Kohl’s, are emerging. A BORS agreement allows customers who buy from the online retailer to make returns at the offline retailer’s stores. In this paper, we examine the strategic impact of the agreement on price competition and profits. Our analysis suggests that the BORS agreement can create an aggressive environment for the offline retailer, despite the additional footfall from returners. However, under certain conditions, the agreement creates an opportunity for the two retailers to carve out a section of the customer base that they can decide not to compete on. As a result of this strategic effect, the agreement can soften price competition, rendering both retailers better off when they are moderately differentiated. Interestingly, the agreement can also curb customers’ showrooming behavior. We also investigate the welfare implications of the agreement and show that it can lead to a win-win-win situation for the online retailer, offline retailer, and consumers.History:Anthony Dukes served as the senior editor.Supplemental Material:The online appendix is available athttps://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2023.0077."
MKSC,2025,"Database Report: Twin-2K-500: A Data Set for Building Digital Twins of over 2,000 People Based on Their Answers to over 500 Questions",https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2025.0262,"Large language model (LLM)-based digital twin simulation, where LLMs are used to emulate individual human behavior, holds great promise for research in business, artificial intelligence, social science, and digital experimentation. However, progress in this area has been hindered by the scarcity of real individual-level data sets that are both large and publicly available. To address this gap, we introduce a large-scale public data set designed to capture a rich and holistic view of individual human behavior. We survey a representative sample of𝑁=2,058N=2,058participants (average 2.42 hours per person) in the United States across four waves with more than 500 questions in total, covering a comprehensive battery of demographic, psychological, economic, personality, and cognitive measures, as well as replications of behavioral economics experiments and a pricing survey. The final wave repeats tasks from earlier waves to establish a test-retest accuracy baseline. Initial analyses suggest the data are of high quality and show promise for constructing digital twins that predict human behavior well at the individual and aggregate levels. Beyond LLM applications, due to its unique breadth and scale, the data set also enables broad social science and business research, including studies of cross-construct correlations and heterogeneous treatment effects.History:Hema Yoganarasimhan served as the senior editor.
