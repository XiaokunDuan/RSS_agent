2025,Orchestrating Digital Resilience: A Clinical IS Study of an Everything-as-a-Service Technology Strategy,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2435975,"Organisations must build digital resilience to effectively safeguard their business operations against environmental, economic, or socio-political disruptions. One approach involvesadaptation– using Information Technology (IT) to design business operations that can withstand and recover from such disruptions. A second approach involvesmitigation– using IT to advance environmental, social, or economic objectives that reduce the root causes and likelihood of future disruptions. However, both approaches to building digital resilience are challenging to implement. Our clinical Information Systems (IS) research article examines and reflects on how Beta Bank, an Australian fintech firm, developed an Everything-as-a-Service (EaaS) technology strategy and achieved digital resilience throughout its business operations. We explain how Beta Bank strategically leveraged EaaS to adapt to the significant disruptions caused by the Australian wildfire disaster and the global COVID pandemic of 2019–2021. We then unpack how Beta Bank further leveraged EaaS to enhance its digital resilience via a mitigation approach. Our work delineates a typology of four EaaS pathways for pursuing digital resilience, discusses the scholarly implications of EaaS as a future IS research area, and provides actionable managerial guidance through an EaaS roadmap, a strategic planning tool for those aiming to implement and benefit from this technology strategy."
2025,Responsible social media use: how user characteristics shape the actualisation of ambiguous affordances,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2444249,"Social media’s dual role as a source of both societal benefits and harms poses significant challenges to its responsible use. While existing literature primarily focuses on organisational and regulatory responsibilities, it sometimes overlooks individual user responsibility. This paper develops a theoretical framework that suggests user characteristics – specifically, conscientiousness and moral tolerance – are key moderators in the responsible (or irresponsible) actualisation of social media’s ambiguous affordances. Grounded in virtue ethics, the framework maintains that four archetypal user characters – narcissist, dogmatist, nihilist, and altruist – shape how social media affordances are actualised. Our work contributes to the Information Systems (IS) literature by adding a nuanced understanding of how responsible use shapes and is shaped by social media users and the sociotechnical context. The framework offers a basis for future research to examine the interaction between user characteristics, affordance ambiguity, and responsible social media use, underscoring the need for technocentric and sociocentric design interventions to promote responsible use."
2025,Data spaces as meta-organisations,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2025.2451250,"Sharing and reusing data across organisations is central to the European data strategy and its transformation towards creating a data-driven economy. Currently, data sharing, when it occurs, is typically facilitated through centralised platforms or bilateral integration solutions, which are increasingly failing to meet requirements for flexibility, trustworthiness, and self-determination over shared data. Data spaces have emerged as a promising solution, built on distributed and shared infrastructure and governance frameworks. However, widespread adoption requires consensus on the necessary organisational and technical capabilities. This paper proposes a data service model and design principles for data services to clarify choices and guide decision-making. We adopt a novel perspective by conceptualising data spaces as meta-organisations to guide an Action Design Research study, utilising privileged access to key large-scale European data space projects in the mobility and automotive sectors. This paper not only develops a nascent design theory for data spaces, but also offers a practical framework, breaking down complex challenges into actionable, scientifically validated components – for further growth and adoption of data spaces."
2025,Designing an immersive virtual reality artefact for disability inclusion: an action design research,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2025.2460805,"People with disabilities (PWD) often face social barriers, such as inaccessible environments, public misunderstandings, and stereotypes, which lead to their exclusion from societal activities. To address this issue, we collaborated with a disability research institute to carry out an action design research (ADR) project aimed at designing an immersive virtual reality (IVR) artefact to cultivate public awareness of the social barriers faced by PWD and foster inclusive attitudes and behaviours towards them. Using technology affordance as a lens, this study went through four interwoven ADR stages to co-design and refine the IVR artefact with researchers, disability groups, IVR and media experts, and end users representing the public. Reflecting on this design process, we distilled our learnings into four design principles to prescribe what and how to craft IVR artefacts for fostering disability inclusion. These principles can guide researchers and practitioners in developing similar IVR artefacts to help address similar problems. Our co-design process, which involved PWDs, enhances the existing understanding and practice of socially inclusive design-oriented research by providing empirical evidence of working with marginalised groups in developing emerging technology artefacts."
2025,The Insider’s Dilemma: Employed Open Source Developers’ Identification Imbalance and Intentions to Leave,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2025.2463984,"In corporate-sponsored open source software development, company-employed developers become “insiders” to the OSS community, and therefore have two roles: they serve as a representative of their employing company, but may also identify as a member of the open source community. This study investigates what happens when identification with the company exceeds identification with the community (and vice versa), and also focuses on consequences when these insider roles come in conflict. Informed by social identity theory and organization-profession conflict theory, we report on two studies that predict identification imbalance to affect company turnover intention. Our first study is based on a survey of employed Linux kernel developers and uses polynomial regression to assess the effect of identification imbalance (and congruence) on company turnover intention. The second study extends our investigation beyond Linux and demonstrates that the effect of identification imbalance on turnover intention is mediated by role conflict. The findings suggest that turnover intention is lowest, when company and community identification match at high rather than low levels. We also find developers’ company career ambition influences how role conflict relates to company turnover intention. This study holds implications for theory and for managers in companies who engage with OSS communities."
2025,Impact of rounded rating display and confidence cues on the subsequent reviews,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2025.2471074,"Online review platforms frequently use rounded rating displays, rounding average ratings to the nearest half-star for simplicity. However, such practice can misguide consumers by creating discrepancies between displayed ratings and actual quality. For example, providers with nearly identical average ratings (e.g. 4.25 and 4.26) might be displayed as 4 and 4.5 stars, respectively, while significantly different providers (e.g. 3.76 and 4.25) might both appear as 4 stars. Such rounding misguides consumers’ pre-purchase expectations and can negatively influence post-purchase satisfaction when consumers’ experiences fail to match expectations. Despite the prevalence of rounded rating displays, their impact on subsequent review behavior remains underexplored. Using a regression discontinuity design and a controlled experiment, we investigate how rounded rating displays influence review generation. Our findings reveal that ratings rounded up (compared to rounded down) prompt consumers to leave reviews with lower ratings and less positive but more negative sentiments. Furthermore, lower rating dispersion and higher information diversity intensify these effects by strengthening consumers’ confidence on pre-purchase expectations. This study underscores the significant role of design features, such as rounded rating displays, in shaping review behavior, providing valuable insights for platform designers seeking to mitigate unintended consequences and improve the way platforms present information."
2025,Online virtual consultation between patients and physicians as interactive affordance,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2025.2473950,"While healthcare providers have widely adopted digital health platforms for patient online virtual consultations, organizations are challenged by difficulties in utilizing them for effective physician–patient interactions. This study investigates online virtual consultations between physicians and patients enabled by their joint use of mobile social media technology. Based on affordance theory, we propose a new type of group-level affordance,interactive affordance, characterized by interactions between users with different predefined roles and varying preferences. We conceptualize interactive affordance as a second-order construct and propose the structure of interactive affordance that is affected by dyadic alignment and individual user affordances, influenced by three determinants (relative advantage, process standardization, and absorptive capacity). The interactive affordance affects two outcomes (physician and patient satisfaction). These relationships were tested using survey data collected from physicians and patients. The results show that interactive affordance actualization is affected by the dyadic alignments of their determinants, and it improves physician satisfaction. This study contributes to the affordance literature by proposing a new type of affordance, interactive affordance. It contributes to the literature on digital health technology used by users with differing preferences by showing the effects of dyadic alignment on the shared use of collaboration technology."
2025,A field experiment on ISP training designs for enhancing employee information security compliance,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2359460,"Information security policy (ISP) training plays an important role in enhancing organisational resilience against cyber threats by providing employees with the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively identify, prevent, and respond to security breaches. This research aims to explore how the use of deterrence arguments and threat arguments can enhance the effectiveness of ISP training. We theorise how ISP training affects employees’ ISP compliance behaviour by arguing for a transfer of training lens to study the effectiveness of ISP training. The results of our field experiment with triangulated data suggest that the effect of argumentative-enhanced ISP training is twofold. First, employees who participated in enhanced training sessions with deterrence and threat arguments demonstrated superior training outputs after the training, which, in turn, translated into a sustained training outcome three weeks after the training. Second, we also find evidence that threat arguments can reinforce the application of training outputs in the maintenance stage of learned behaviours. With this applied research study, we contribute to the research and practice by providing empirical evidence of the effectiveness of ISP training designs."
2025,The co-evolution of contract and software artefact in cloudsourcing,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2380707,"Propelled by the promise of cost savings and enhanced service quality, cloudsourcing has become the largest segment of the global outsourcing market. In practice, however, managing cloudsourcing projects is notoriously challenging because they morph into complex, multi-year endeavours that entail frequent adaptations of both the cloud service and the contract in response to emergent goals. This study develops and explores the idea that in this adaptation process, the outsourcing contract and software artefact become closely connected. When making contracting decisions, clients must consider that cloud services are built on standardised multi-tenant architectures, offer predefined customisation options, and evolve continuously. Therefore, we explore the dynamic interplay between contract and cloud-based software artefact in response to emergent goals. Drawing from a longitudinal study of four cloudsourcing cases, we reveal two patterns: co-evolutionary polarisation and co-evolutionary harmonisation. The former, driven by positive reinforcement, intensifies tensions between initial and emergent goals, manifesting in projects drifting away from goals. The latter, characterised by balancing feedback, facilitates a flexible trajectory, enabling stepwise reconciliation of initial and emergent goals. These findings offer significant theoretical contributions to the management of sourcing projects, especially in cloud contexts, and provide actionable insights for managers navigating the complex dynamics of cloudsourcing."
2025,Achieving strategic alignment between business and information technology with information technology governance: the role of commitment to principles and Top Leadership Support,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2390998,"IT governance (ITG) is crucial in achieving IT strategic alignment, but many organizations find this to be an elusive goal. We thus expand ITG into two components: ITG mechanisms and ITG principles. We propose that beyond the mere option of ITG mechanisms, organizations must fully embrace the broader “spirit” of ITG, which occurs when an organization is committed to ITG principles coupled with top leadership support. To test our theorization, we first developed and validated two new measures. We used the ITG framework of COBIT to create a measure of commitment to COBIT principles (CCP), and we found that CCP fully mediates ITG mechanisms’ relationship with strategic alignment. We thus illuminate a missing link between adopting ITG mechanisms and achieving strategic alignment by demonstrating the need to focus on ITG principles. We show that top leadership support for IT, including support at the board level, not only enhances CCP but also directly contributes to improved strategic alignment. Our study establishes that adopting ITG mechanisms is necessary but insufficient for achieving strategic alignment. Effective organizations go beyond implementing isolated ITG mechanisms; they fully embrace integrated COBIT-based principles, guided by a strong infusion of top leadership support, including board-level support."
2025,Reducing the incidence of biased algorithmic decisions through feature importance transparency: an empirical study,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2395531,"As firms move towards data-driven decision-making using algorithmic systems, concerns are raised regarding the lack of transparency of these systems which could have ramifications related to users’ trust and the potential for provoking discriminatory decisions. Although previous research has developed methods to improve algorithmic transparency, little empirical evidence exists regarding the extent of the effectiveness of these approaches. Drawing upon Rest’s theory of ethical decision-making and the literature on algorithmic transparency and bias, we investigate the effectiveness of feature importance (FI), a common transparency-enhancing approach, which illustrates the nature and the weights of the features utilised by an algorithm. Through an online experiment employing a fictitious tool that provided recommendations for selecting employees for a promotion-related training programme, we find that FI is effective when biased recommendations include direct discrimination (i.e. when individuals are treated less favourably on protected grounds such as gender); but is of little assistance when discrimination is indirect (i.e. when a criterion or practice that is apparently neutral, disadvantages a group of individuals who are of a protected class). Additionally, we propose a new transparency approach, using aggregated demographic information, to accompany FI in indirect discrimination circumstances and report the results of testing its effects."
2025,Examining the impact of mobile gambling harm minimisation features: a dualistic model of passion perspective,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2396964,"Driven by the ubiquity of smartphones, sports gambling has intensified globally. Most mobile gambling apps are mandated to offer harm minimisation features which are IT tools designed to help prevent harmful gambling activity. Existing research on the effectiveness of gambling harm minimisation features often overlooks the fact that individuals engage with multiple IT tools to varying extents to achieve a single goal. As an initial step, and to reflect actual user engagement, we conduct an exploratory factor analysis on a range of opt-in harm minimisation features. Next, aligned with the dualistic model of passion, we theorise and empirical test how direct and indirect harm minimisation features moderate the translation of different passions for mobile gambling into the well-being outcome of subjective vitality. Our findings suggest that indirect harm minimisation features, but not direct features, are effective in protecting the well-being of obsessively passionate mobile gamblers. For harmoniously passionate mobile gamblers, the opposite situation holds – direct harm minimisation features strengthen the effect of a harmonious passion on vitality whereas indirect features have no significant effect."
2025,Determinants of gamification effectiveness: perspectives of technology affordances and coping responses in the context of team-based gamified training,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2398600,"Firms face significant challenges in effectively training employees in adopting complex information systems, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP). Gamified training has emerged as a promising means to address these challenges. Despite this, prior research has paid little attention to the factors affecting the effective use of gamified training. This study aims to identify the determinants of the effective use of gamified training. Based on technology affordances, coping, and gamification literature, the study proposes that team-based gamification affordances (e.g. collaboration and competition affordances) affect coping responses (e.g. task-focused, emotion-focused, and avoidance coping), leading to effective use. We utilized the ERP simulation game to empirically test the research model, employing a multi-study approach comprising two studies (Study 1 = 255 participants, Study 2 = 219 participants). Structural equation modelling was used for data analysis. Our results indicate that collaboration affordance significantly affects task-focused, emotion-focused, and avoidance coping. However, competition affordance influenced only task-focused coping. We also found that task-focused and emotion-focused coping affected effective use. This study contributes to IS literature by highlighting gamification affordances and coping responses as important predictors of effective use in gamified training, leading organizations and IS scholars to design impactful and engaging gamified training programmes."
2025,Unveiling motivational configurations in shaping meaningful engagement in green gamification,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2404968,"Green gamification embeds game elements into non-game green information systems to tackle environmental degradation by encouraging pro-environmental behaviours. However, its real-world impact has been limited by a lack of meaningful engagement among users. To overcome this challenge, it is crucial to promote meaningful engagement through motivations and explore the intricate relationships that underlie them. We propose a configurational model based on self-determination theory to explore how different motivations combine to impact the two meaningful engagement outcomes: experiential outcome (participation for positive experience) and instrumental outcome (participation to fulfil specific tasks). Using a two-wave longitudinal design with both subjective and objective data, we conduct necessary condition analysis and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to identify four configurations that stimulate meaningful engagement. Specifically, the experiential outcome is driven by a combination of high hedonic, high pro-environmental, high social interaction, and low recognition motivations. The instrumental outcome is enhanced by configurations of high intrinsic (hedonic and achievement), low pro-environmental, and high self-expression (or low recognition) motivations. These findings yield four propositions that provide a theoretical foundation for future research and practical insights for designing more effective green gamification applications."
2025,From cyber benign to cyber malicious: unveiling the evolution of insider cyber maliciousness from a stage theory perspective,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2413072,"Insider cyber maliciousness presents a significant challenge to organizational security. Existing research has focused on identifying determinants of malicious cyber behavior but has not accounted for the progression insiders go through in arriving at the point where they look to harm their employers. This knowledge gap prevents organizations from potentially derailing acts of cyber maliciousness through timely interventions. Based on interviews with a cross-industry sample of organizational insiders, this study adopts a stage theory development approach to explore the progression of insiders from cyber benign to cyber malicious. Stage theories are useful frameworks that help explain how individuals’ perceptions, emotions, and/or behaviors progress through distinct and qualitatively different stages of development. By uncovering the initial, subsequent, and recurring perceptions and emotions that drive insiders to engage in malicious cyber activities, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the phenomenon. Our findings establish a new basis for understanding insider cyber maliciousness, presenting it as an evolutionary progression. As such, our findings also reorient the focus of malicious insider interventions toward strain-reducing or strain-relieving interventions based on the initial, subsequent, or recurring strain experiences."
2025,To learn or not learn from AI? Unpacking the effects of feedback valence on novel insights recall,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2426473,"Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are unique pedagogical agents, in that (1) they can generate novel insights, and (2) they tend to be treated differently by humans, because they are opaquer and more intelligent than traditional technologies. Thus, it is not clear if and how people learn novel insights through AI feedback, and if the learning process and outcomes differ compared to when the source of insights and feedback is humans. Here, we seek to address this gap with four preregistered experiments (totaln=1,766). They use a learning paradigm in which we manipulate the feedback source, feedback valence, and test instructions. The key finding is that people learn novel insights better when they receive negative feedback from AI than from humans. There is no difference in recall for positive feedback. This implies that AI as pedagogical agents are likely to outperform human feedback sources (peers or experts), or at least, be no worse. Our results further reveal that (1) people present typical human-human learning biases when receiving negative feedback from AI, namely mnemic neglect, and (2) ego bruising (as manifested in reduction in state self-esteem) and anger mediate such effects when receiving negative feedback from AI."
