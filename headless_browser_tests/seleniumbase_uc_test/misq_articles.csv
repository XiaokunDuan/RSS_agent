The Critical Challenge of using Large-Scale Digital Experiment Platforms for Scientific Discovery,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/5,"Robust digital experimentation platforms have become increasingly pervasive at major technology and e-commerce firms worldwide. They allow product managers to use data-driven decision-making through online controlled experiments that estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) relative to a status quo control setting and make associated inferences. As demand for experiments continues to grow, orthogonal test planes (OTPs) have become the industry standard for managing the assignment of users to multiple concurrent experimental treatments in companies using large-scale digital experimentation platforms. In recent years, firms have begun to recognize that test planes might be confounding experimental results, but nevertheless, the practical benefits outweigh the costs. However, the uptick in practitioner-led digital experiments has coincided with an increase in academic-industry research partnerships, where large-scale digital experiments are being used to scientifically answer research questions, validate design choices, and/or derive computational social science-based empirical insights. In such contexts, confounding and biased estimation may have much more pronounced implications for the validity of scientific findings, contributions to theory, building a cumulative literature, and ultimately practice. The purpose of this Issues and Opinions article is to shed light on OTPs—in our experience, most researchers are unaware of how such test planes can lead to incorrect inferences. We used a case study conducted at a major e-commerce company to illustrate the extent to which interactions in concurrent experiments can bias ATEs, often making them appear more positive than they actually are. We discuss implications for research, including the distinction between practical industry experiments and academic research, methodological best practices for mitigating such concerns, and transparency and reproducibility considerations stemming from the complexity and opacity of large-scale experimentation platforms. More broadly, we worry that confounding in scientific research due to reliance on large-scale digital experiments meant to serve a different purpose is a microcosm of a larger epistemological confounding regarding what constitutes a contribution to scientific knowledge."

Organizing for AI Innovation: Insights from an Empirical Exploration of U.S. Patents,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/13,"Although the prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI) innovations is on the rise, firms frequently report failures and setbacks in their development and implementation of AI innovation efforts. One common issue behind many failing AI initiatives is that they are organized just like other information technology (IT) innovation efforts. To elucidate why and how the production of AI and IT innovations may need to be managed differently, this study juxtaposes these two types of innovations based on two key dimensions of the Schumpeterian framework: the form (product vs. process) and magnitude (radical vs. incremental) of innovations. By analyzing a matched sample of AI and IT patents, we found robust evidence that AI innovations are less radical and more process oriented than comparable IT innovations. Drawing upon our empirical discovery, we developed a conceptual framework to suggest a new way to think about organizing AI innovation. Our research contributes to the literature and practice on AI innovation by illuminating the comparative differences between AI innovations and other IT innovations and advancing a set of empirically derived propositions on how firms may be able to better manage their AI innovation activities."
Human Capital Acquisition in Response to Data Breaches,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/19,"Given the rise in the frequency and cost of data security threats, it is critical to understand whether and how companies strategically adapt their operational workforce in response to data breaches. We study hiring in the aftermath of data breaches by combining information on data breach events with detailed firm-level job posting data. Using a staggered difference-in-differences approach, we show that breached firms significantly increase their demand for cybersecurity workers. Furthermore, firms’ responses to data breaches extend to promptly recruiting public relations personnel—an act aimed at managing trust and alleviating negative publicity—often ahead of cybersecurity hires. Following a breach, the likelihood of firms posting a cybersecurity job rises by approximately two percentage points, which translates to an average willingness to spend an additional $61,961 in annual wages on cybersecurity, public relations, and legal workers. While these hiring adjustments are small for affected firms, they represent a large potential impact of over $300 million on the overall economy. Our findings underscore the vital role of human capital investments in shaping firms’ cyber defenses and provide a valuable roadmap for managers and firms navigating cyberthreats in an increasingly digital age."
How Artifact-Based and Authority-Based Coordination Affect Propagation Costs in Open Source Software Development,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/19,"The success of open source software (OSS) projects depends on their ability to produce software architectures with low propagation costs, as such architectures demand little effort from developers. This study focuses on the project’s form of coordination—the way in which interdependent contributions are managed—as a driving force behind propagation costs. It distinguishes between two coordination archetypes. First, artifact-based coordination is found in egalitarian projects, in which developers only use the work artifact (the architecture itself), without direct interaction, to coordinate. Second, authority-based coordination is used in hierarchical projects (e.g., Linux Kernel) or when companies pay developers for their work. Using a computational model, this study compares these two coordination mechanisms by simulating how they build software architectures (formalized as design structure matrices) from interdependent contributions. As a contextual condition, the model considers the degree of architecture visibility, which is the developers’ (in)ability to see recent additions to the architecture. The model provides two insights. First, artifact-based coordination, as compared to authority-based coordination, generally leads to lower propagation costs. Second, decreasing the degree of architecture visibility reduces propagation costs, an effect that I describe as focal-layered superposition. These insights contribute to the literatures on coordination in OSS development and the mirroring hypothesis. They also have practical implications for the creation of preferable architectures in OSS development."
Producing the “We” in High-Risk Online Activism: Identity Configurations in My Stealthy Freedom,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/9,"The research on online social movements generally concludes that collective identity, i.e., the sense of we-ness that individual protesters in a movement share, is not only unattainable but also dispensable, even though it is considered a defining feature of traditional movements. In this paper, we explore one of the boundary conditions of these findings, namely the riskiness of protest practices. Analysing the high-risk social movement, My Stealthy Freedom (MySF), which contests compulsory hijab in Iran in a way that hybridizes online and offline protest practices, we show that a sense of collectiveness can be instantiated in online social movements, why it is critical to the success of high-risk activism, and how it is (re)produced. Comparing and contrasting three instantiations of MySF, each of which was enacted on a different social media platform, we develop a theoretical model of how feelings of collectiveness are enacted in high-risk online activism. In addition to providing guidance for online movements where collective identity is desirable, our study challenges prior research on online activism by theorizing the role of embodiment, affect, and the dialectic between activists’ personal and the movement’s collective identity."
Rebalancing Novelty with Rigor and Relevance in Information Systems Research,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/4,September 2025 - Editor's Comments
When Algorithms Delegate to Humans: Exploring Human-Algorithm Interaction at Uber,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/16,"Algorithms are increasingly seen as capable of autonomously initiating and managing interactions with humans—for example, through delegating the rights and responsibilities for successful outcomes of shared tasks without human intervention. While research into such interactions primarily focuses on dyadic configurations, complex settings where multiple agents work together have become a nexus of more nuanced interactions that go beyond the dyad. This paper explores such interactions through the lens of delegation by investigating how many algorithms delegate to many humans in a multi-agent setting. Analyzing patent data and interviews with drivers and passengers, we unpack delegation in the context of the ride-hailing application Uber. We theorize distributed delegation as a construct capturing collective hybrid appraisal, collective hybrid distribution, and collective hybrid coordination, in which a collective of algorithms delegates by drawing on inputs from multiple human agents. Our findings highlight that distributed delegation is collective, hybrid, and relational by nature, and demonstrate the extent to which human inputs are necessary for collectives of algorithms to exercise the capacity to delegate. Distributed delegation as a continuum of algorithmic and human involvement poses a challenge for recent theories suggesting the unprecedented autonomy of algorithms from humans."
Mobile Advertising in Distracted Environments: Exploring the Impact of Distractions on Dual-Task Interference,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/11,"It is increasingly common for consumers to engage with various tasks on their personal devices amid other distractions such as watching television at home, shopping at malls, or attending concerts. While this split in attention poses challenges, it also opens valuable opportunities for advertisers to strategically push targeted advertisements based on information about the user’s environment. Across a series of controlled lab experiments using a custom app developed for this study, we demonstrate how marketers can optimize pop-up advertising on consumers’ personal devices within distraction-filled environments. In doing so, we extend traditional insights from dual-task interference studies that have previously focused on corresponding tasks in isolation, without considering any stimuli from the environment. Our results indicate that, in the presence of additional stimuli from the environment, a facilitating relationship exists between the attention paid to a task and the effectiveness of pop-up advertisements interrupting the task. However, this relationship is moderated by the extent of attention diffusion from the environment. As the distance between the task and the environment increases, consumer attention to the task is more diffused, resulting in poorer encoding of the pop-up advertisements. Critically, optimizing the content and timing of pop-up advertisements to the environmental content can significantly improve their effectiveness. Our results have important implications for helping marketers develop actionable strategies for mobile advertising in distraction-filled environments."
Supporting Community First Responders in Aging in Place: An Action Design for a Community-Based Smart Activity Monitoring System,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/15,"To maintain elderly individuals’ ability to live independently in their own homes, technologies such as sensors and the internet of things can be used to facilitate real-time monitoring and automate emergency detection and alerts to enable first responders to deliver help on time. This study examines the design problems associated with such activity monitoring systems, particularly how to support the situational awareness of community first responders who are located remotely and do not have professional healthcare knowledge. Based on a three-year action design research study that investigated a sensor-based monitoring system for elderly people deployed in a natural community setting, we developed abstract design knowledge. Four design principles aimed at enhancing responders’ perceptions, comprehension, and projection of information are proposed to promote informed decision-making and timely responses by drawing on the situational awareness model. In addition to the nascent design knowledge regarding remote activity monitoring in different instances, this study extends our knowledge of the community-based model by foregrounding its multiplicity and the active roles of community stakeholders in providing care to elderly people."
Privacy Concerns and Data Donations: Do Societal Benefits Matter?,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/6,"Data donations, where individuals are encouraged to donate their personal information, have the potential to advance medical research and help limit the spread of pandemics, among other benefits. The decision to donate data is fundamentally a privacy decision. In this research, we build on the privacy calculus, a model describing privacy risks and benefits, and examine the impact of privacy concerns on data donation decisions, highlighting the role of societal benefits in privacy decisions. Based on two randomized experiments using the general context of data donation for medical research (Experiment 1) and the specific context of data donation for COVID-19 research (Experiment 2), we find that individuals who are highly concerned about privacy tend to donate less data (Experiments 1 and 2). This effect holds under a variety of conditions and is consistent with prevailing research. However, this effect is contingent on the privacy calculus. When implicit or explicit societal benefits are perceived, particularly in the absence of privacy controls, the association between privacy concerns and data donation decisions is less salient, highlighting the significant role that societal benefits play in privacy decisions. We discuss the theoretical, practical, social, and ethical implications of these findings."
The Hidden Cost of IT Innovation: Access to Emerging Technologies and the Gender Wage Gap,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/14,"Although an extensive information systems literature has explored the economic benefits of information technology (IT) investments, how these benefits are distributed between male and female IT workers has not been as closely examined. This paper bridges this gap by addressing two questions: (1) Do women and men have similar opportunities to acquire skills related to new IT innovations? (2) How do these differences affect the gender pay gap? We argue that women are underrepresented in roles that use emerging technologies due to two interrelated processes: demand-side labor market conditions and supply-side job sorting. By analyzing two independent datasets that provide insights into wages, career trajectories, and skill prerequisites for IT roles, we found that women are less likely to apply for jobs requiring expertise with emerging technologies. Such positions often require extended work hours, frequent job mobility, and geographic relocation—which can conflict with the family responsibilities typically assumed by women. Yet because these positions tend to offer higher wages, women’s underrepresentation in these roles exacerbates the gender pay gap in the IT sector. Our findings stress the importance of creating more flexible job structures and enhancing women’s access to emerging technology roles as critical for achieving gender equity in the IT industry."

“Complexity Is the Worst Enemy of Security”: Studying Cybersecurity Through the Lens Of Organizational Complexity,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/12,"Writing about computer systems twenty-five years ago, Schneier wrote that “the worst enemy of security is complexity” (Schneier, 1999), because complex systems are both easier to attack and harder to secure than simpler ones. In this essay, we provide an overview of Schneier’s complexity principle and provide our observations of how two articles in this issue, Liang et al. (2025) and Tanriverdi et al. (2025), employed this principle in their research. We also offer our ideas for why complexity and cybersecurity are especially amenable for study in the field of information systems and where future research can go from here."
The Interplay Between Healthcare Information Technologies and Denied Claims,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/16,"This study investigates the role of health information technology (HIT) in reducing claim denials, which are a significant burden for healthcare providers in the U.S. We theorize the impacts of electronic health records (EHRs) on claim denials, starting with an examination of EHR adoption and followed by a deeper assessment of how EHRs are sourced both within a hospital and across hospitals in the same health system. We propose that while EHR adoption reduces the likelihood of claim denials by improving the accuracy and completeness of information processing, it can also increase claim denials if EHR applications are sourced from multiple vendors within a hospital or different vendors across hospitals. Using a large-scale dataset of claim records from the state of Maryland from 2012-2016, we found that the greater the EHR adoption by care providers, the less likely a claim is denied. In addition, our findings suggest that EHRs are more effective in preventing denials when a hospital sources EHR applications from a single vendor and when a group of hospitals in the same health system sources EHRs from the same vendor. Additionally, we observed a decrease in claim denials when physicians previously worked in hospitals utilizing EHR applications from the same vendor. This study provides significant theoretical insights into the information systems literature on HIT and offers practical implications for healthcare providers by uncovering the multifaceted roles of EHRs in information processing and compliance."

"Automating in High-Expertise, Low-Label Environments: Evidence-Based Medicine by Expert-Augmented Few-Shot Learning",https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/12,"Many real-world process automation environments are rife with high-expertise and limited labeled data. We propose a computational design science artifact to automate systematic review (SR) in such an environment. SR is a manual process that collects and synthesizes data from medical literature to inform medical decisions and improve clinical practice. Existing machine learning solutions for SR automation suffer from a lack of labeled data and a misrepresentation of the high-expertise manual process. Motivated by humans’ impressive capability to learn from limited examples, we propose a principled and generalizable few-shot learning framework—FastSR—to automate the multistep, expertise-intensive SR process using minimal training data. Informed by SR experts’ annotation logic, FastSR extends the traditional few-shot learning framework by including (1) various representations to account for diverse SR knowledge, (2) attention mechanisms to reflect semantic correspondence of medical text fragments, and (3) shared representations to jointly learn interrelated tasks (i.e., sentence classification and sequence tagging). We instantiated and evaluated FastSR on three test beds: full-text articles from Wilson disease (WD) and COVID-19, as well as a public dataset (EBM-NLP) containing clinical trial abstracts on a wide range of diseases. Our experiments demonstrate that FastSR significantly outperforms several benchmarking solutions and expedites the SR project by up to 65%. We critically examine the SR outcomes and practical advantages of FastSR compared to other ML and manual SR solutions and propose a new FastSR-augmented protocol. Overall, our multifaceted evaluation quantitatively and qualitatively underscores the efficacy and applicability of FastSR in expediting SR. Our results have important implications for designing computational artifacts for automating/augmenting processes in high-expertise, low-label environments."
Advancing Understanding of Scaling Health Information Infrastructures: Learning from EHR Initiatives in England,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/17,"Many countries are developing health information infrastructures (HII) such as integrated electronic health records (EHRs) as a means of improving healthcare efficiency and effectiveness. However, efforts to build and scale up HII are fraught with challenges, as exemplified by the well-known case of the National Health Service (NHS) in England. In particular, HII scaling initiatives give rise to tensions, such as across geographical boundaries of EHRs, which are often not effectively addressed in practice. At the same time, there have been calls for research on scaling IS through a practice perspective, which adds to the existing categorical analysis of scale. Thus motivated, we aim to conceptualize the scaling of HII, focusing on the tensions between scales, the practices to accomplish scaling, and their consequences for scaling outcomes. To do so, we undertook a case study of recent NHS efforts to integrate EHRs in England, where we analyzed these scalar concepts and their interrelationships. Our study further develops the notion that scaling not only involves increasing the scale of IS but entails constructing and reconstructing scales. We also offer theoretical contributions by conceptualizing the range of scalar tensions and practices, their interplay, and their influences on HII scaling outcomes. Tensions that we identify as associated with different scale boundaries (organizational, spatial, and technological), extend those recognized in prior research. Furthermore, we uncover the scalar practices of joining and differentiating, adding to the governance and architectural approaches for HII scaling examined in past work. Through deepening the understanding of HII scaling, we generate insights for practitioners by highlighting scalar tensions and practices that could address the tensions under different conditions. Overall, we draw attention to scaling phenomena as being integral to the development of HII and introduce a new vocabulary for thinking about HII scaling."

"Information Technology Firms and Revenue Stall, 1950-2015: Theory and Empirical Evidence",https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/19,"A slowdown in revenue growth, referred to as revenue stall in this study, is a key concern for any firm. We examine how information technology-producing firms (i.e., IT firms) differ from non-IT firms in experiencing revenue stall and in benefiting from R&D investments in terms of reduced revenue stall. We hypothesize that whereas IT firms experience more revenue stall than non-IT firms, R&D investments reduce revenue stall to a greater extent in IT firms than in non-IT firms. Our empirical analyses of a longitudinal dataset of more than 1,400 large public firms in the United States from 1950 to 2015 broadly support our hypotheses. Consistent with the theoretical arguments underlying our hypotheses, we also find that IT firms experience higher competition, dynamism, and turbulence, and have higher intangible assets than non-IT firms."

"Disentangling the Customer-Level, Cross-Channel Effects of Large-Order-Advantaged Online Shipping Policies",https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/15,"A key challenge in e-commerce retail is identifying a shipping fee policy that will incentivize more online orders and sales. To achieve this, retailers occasionally alter their shipping policies. While information systems research has extensively examined e-commerce channel strategies and their interplay with offline channels, it has yet to explore the online and offline implications of changes in e-commerce shipping policies. Against this backdrop, we studied a shipping policy change designed to incentivize higher-dollar orders, specifically, a large multichannel retailer’s shift from a tiered online shipping policy to a flat-rate policy. Using rich customer-level panel data and a regression discontinuity in time approach, we demonstrate that a flat-fee online shipping policy, counterintuitively, shifts sales away from the online channel and toward the offline channel—generating 23% more offline sales across 21,028 customers in five states. Evidence from additional analyses corroborated an account based on two mechanisms: an online order aggregation effect, wherein flat-fee shipping encouraged shipping fee-sensitive shoppers to aggregate purchases into larger orders, and an offline store interpurchase effect, wherein order aggregation generated longer interpurchase periods, during which customers met their needs for smaller purchases by visiting offline stores. Thus, a flat-rate shipping policy can serve as an unexpected lever for driving multichannel behavior. These findings contribute to the e-commerce channel interplay literature within information systems research and have important implications for legacy retailers seeking to leverage their brick-and-mortar investments to fend off competition from online-native retailers such as Amazon.com."
How Mergers and Acquisitions Increase Data Breaches: A Complexity Perspective,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/13,"This study examines how the mergers and acquisitions (M&As) of a firm influence its number of data breaches. Drawing from complexity theory and matching theory, we propose that M&As increase data breaches and this effect is contingent on M&A diversity (dissimilarity between the parent and target firms). Based on the 18-year panel data (2004-2021) of 5,072 public firms in the United States, we find that more M&As by a firm lead to more data breaches. Moreover, we reveal that the number of data breaches increases even more when the parent and target firms operate in different business domains. This finding is confirmed when we operationalize M&A diversity as size discrepancy or a strategic type difference between the parent firm and the target firm (vertical vs. horizontal M&A). Furthermore, based on routine activity theory, we explore two additional moderating mechanisms through which M&As influence data breaches: M&A media publicity and target vulnerability. Our analyses demonstrate that M&As with higher media publicity experience more data breaches than those with lower media publicity, but counterintuitively, M&As involving a more vulnerable target firm lead to fewer data breaches than those involving a less vulnerable target firm. This study not only confirms the impact of M&As on data breach recurrence but also unveils various underlying mechanisms of this impact, thus contributing to both research and practice in cybersecurity and information systems."
Correcting Measurement Error in Regression Models with Variables Constructed from Aggregated Output of Data Mining Models,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/6,"The burgeoning interest in data mining has catalyzed a proliferation of innovative techniques in extracting useful information from unstructured data sources, such as text and images in social sciences. One typical research design involves a two-stage process. In the first stage, researchers apply the classification algorithm to predict an individual-level categorical variable. In the second stage, researchers aggregate the predicted values to construct a group-level variable for further regression analysis. For example, text classification has been applied to classify whether a review is positive or negative. The predicted review sentiment is aggregated at the product level as a focal independent variable in a regression model to examine the impact of the average review sentiment on product sales. Since the first-stage classification will inevitably have errors, the aggregated variable may suffer from a measurement error in the regression analysis. Our study attempts to systematically investigate the theoretical properties of the estimation bias and introduce solutions rooted in theory to mitigate the issue of measurement error. We propose one exact solution and two approximated solutions based on the central limit theorem (CLT) and the law of large numbers (LLN), respectively. Our theoretical analysis and experimentation confirm that the consistency of regression estimators can be recovered across all examined scenarios and the approximated solutions offer a significantly reduced computational complexity compared to the exact solution. We also provide heuristic guidelines to choose one of three solutions."
How Collaboration Technology Use Affects IT Project Team Creativity: Integrating Team Knowledge and Creative Synthesis Perspectives,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/12,"Contemporary IT project teams engage in creative problem solving to address increasingly complex business problems, highlighting the need to promote IT project team creativity. Collaboration technologies are widely used in IT project teams, but little is known about what collaboration technology features can be used to improve IT project team creativity and what the underlying influencing mechanisms are. To address this important gap, the current study builds on the extended team knowledge framework to identify collaboration technology features and decodes their influencing mechanisms on IT project team creativity by drawing on the novel creative synthesis theory originating in the management literature to the IT project team context. We identify three sets of collaboration technology support features—awareness knowledge supports, long-term knowledge supports, and transitional knowledge supports—and posit that their use can improve IT project team creativity by facilitating the creative synthesis process, which includes the three subconstructs of collective attention, similarity building, and enacting ideas. The research model is supported in general by empirical data collected through a multisourced survey of over 500 team members and their leaders from 62 IT project teams. We conclude with a discussion of theoretical and practical implications."
Regulating Emerging Technologies: Prospective Sensemaking through Abstraction and Elaboration,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/11,"Emerging digital technologies require regulation that will avoid harmful effects but that also, ideally, fosters innovation. We report on a case study of how actors, representing a variety of perspectives (legal, regulatory authority, government, industry, and technology), interacted to construct a law on trustworthy technology in the European state of Liechtenstein. This regulatory construction was enabled by collective prospective sensemaking relying on the interrelated processes of abstraction and elaboration, through which actors collectively reconceptualized the regulatory target in terms of the technology (from blockchain to trustworthy technology), its uses (from cryptocurrency to token economy), and required roles (from financial service provider roles to trustworthy technology systems roles). Abstraction allowed the group of actors to extract and generalize essential properties to support the regulatory goals of technology neutrality and innovation-friendliness. Elaboration allowed the group to identify and specify details and requirements to support the regulatory goals of creating legal certainty and protecting users. Through these processes, actors could construct a shared, collective understanding that accommodated various viewpoints and paved the way for writing a law. From this case study, we develop a theory of collective prospective sensemaking in regulating emerging technologies."
Deliberative or Automatic: Disentangling the Dual Processes Behind the Persuasive Power of Online Word-of-Mouth,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/17,"As online reviews become increasingly indispensable for consumers, they have attracted significant attention from both practitioners and researchers. It is a common belief that the persuasive effect of online reviews involves a deliberative and conscious process. Drawing on dual-process theories and the persuasion literature, we challenge this conventional wisdom, distinguish Type 2 processing (which requires deliberation) and Type 1 processing (which occurs automatically), and disentangle their relative impacts. With a focus on review elaborateness and review exposure, we propose that the automatic process of review exposure may play a greater role than elaborateness in changing consumers’ attitudes and purchase intentions. In addition, in line with the negativity bias, we posit that the persuasive impact of review exposure (vs. elaborateness) is moderated by the valence of highly exposed reviews. The results of the two experiments provide consistent support for these predictions. Our findings complement and extend the emerging literature starting to explore the role of automatic Type 1 processing in consumers’ use of online reviews, reveal the primary driver of persuasion and its boundary condition in online word-of-mouth, and provide important implications for review platforms, product manufacturers, and retailers."
Defending Your Own or Trolling the Haters: A Configurational Approach to Incivility in Online Communities,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/11,"This study explores the emergence of incivility in online communities, challenging the traditional perspective that attributes incivility to individual elements of sociotechnical systems. We argue that this narrow focus fails to recognize the complex interactions between these elements, leading to a rudimentary understanding of how incivility originates and evolves. To address this gap, our research employed fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), examining approximately 4.3 million posts from 100 diverse online communities on Reddit. Through this analysis, we identified five distinct paths that converged into two primary community configurations: close-knit and scattered communities. Each configuration exhibits unique affordances whose activation fosters incivility in different ways. Based on these findings, we expand the understanding of incivility to include subtle, indirect behaviors beyond overt forms such as trolling or hate speech and show how the interplay of multiple community elements produces affordances, avoiding the narrow view of individual affordances and shedding light on variations of social systems. Finally, we demonstrate that within the same digital platform, different social systems can impact user behaviors, including incivility."
Behavior Toward Newcomers and Contributions to Online Communities,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/16,"In this paper, we study whether and how behavior toward newcomers impacts their socialization outcomes in terms of retention and the quality of contributions in online communities. By exploiting a natural experiment on a large deal-sharing platform, we found that an intervention that proactively reminds other community members to be more considerate of newcomers caused newcomer deals to receive 54% more comments and increased the positive sentiment of the comments. The newcomers in the treatment group were 10% more likely than newcomers in the non-treatment group to post another deal, suggesting an increase in retention. However, we did not observe any effect of the intervention on the quality of subsequent contributions. Our evidence suggests that the intervention merely caused a temporary shock to newcomers’ first contributions but did not improve their learning or motivate greater effort in subsequent contributions. We draw implications on the design of socialization processes to help communities improve the retention and performance of newcomers."
Engaging Physicians with Introductory Incentives: References to Online and Offline Income,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/8,"Incentives make or break user contributions. While providing introductory incentives to attract new users has become increasingly popular among online communities, their impact on user contributions remains largely unknown. Utilizing a policy change that doubled the incentives paid to physicians in a leading online health community, we examined the impacts of both the initiation and the termination of such introductory incentives on physician contributions (in terms of patient consultations) and how the impacts varied according to the physician’s online and offline income. We found that despite an increase in physician contributions during the policy window, the introductory incentives unintentionally decreased physician contributions after the policy window ended. Additionally, physicians tended to anchor their contributions using their online rather than offline income as a reference point, suggesting that mental accounting was at play. Our findings provide a cautionary perspective on the unintended consequences of using introductory incentives and reveal the associated mechanisms of mental accounting when users make contributions (or not) to online communities. These findings provide important implications for incentive design and user engagement in online communities."
Fake News and True News Assessment: The Persuasive Effect of Discursive Evidence in Judging Veracity,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/5,"Individuals are often unable to assess the veracity of news claims—especially on social media platforms. Recent research has suggested that interventions indicating normative signals, such as flagging false claims, are not always effective. We propose an approach in which users are provided with discursive evidence to consider in determining the veracity of claims rather than depending on normative true or false flags. We conducted a series of experiments to explore the effects of different forms of discursive evidence on individual judgments of the veracity of news claims. We found that providing such evidence can significantly improve individuals’ judgment of both true and false news claims—with certain caveats. Providing discursive evidence with high evidence strength leads to a general increase in veracity judgment. Discursive evidence containing items with lower evidence strength may shift believability—thus improving judgments for either true or false claims but degrading them for the other. We also identify important asymmetries between true and false claims, finding that the effect of some evidence may be improved if people are in a more critical mindset—for example, by priming them to think about the concept of truth and lies. Taken together, these results extend knowledge on the problem of fake news and may suggest effective approaches to address the problem without diminishing attention to true news."
Regulating Digital Platform Ecosystems Through Data Sharing and Data Siloing: Consequences for Innovation and Welfare,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/9,"Digital platform ecosystems thrive on their ability to acquire and leverage user data across multiple data-driven services. This enables dominant platforms to harness insights obtained from their primary markets, where user data is collected, thus gaining a competitive advantage in secondary markets, where they exploit this data. While data cross-use brings about efficiencies, policymakers worldwide have expressed concerns about the economic power and the potential distortion of competition and innovation incentives associated with it. To address these concerns, two distinct and targeted policy interventions have been suggested: data siloing, which restricts the cross-use of data within platform ecosystems, and mandated data sharing with competitors. Using an analytical model that examines data cross-use in digital platform ecosystems, we analyzed the impact of data siloing and data sharing obligations, and their interaction on competition, innovation, consumer welfare, and overall social welfare. Our findings indicate that an optimal policy involves data sharing without data siloing, whereas the EU’s Digital Markets Act currently mandates both types of data cross-use regulation."
Self-Organization and Governance in Digital Platform Ecosystems: An Information Ecology Approach,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/8,"This research investigates the interplay of top-down control and bottom-up self-organization within digital platform ecosystems (DPEs), focusing on the formation and management of complementor coalitions. Although these coalitions can increase a DPE’s generativity, they can also threaten its integrity. We investigate this tension by employing information ecology (IE) theory, which allows us to examine complementor coalitions as holons that navigate between self-assertiveness and integration within the structural hierarchies of DPEs. Utilizing an inductive, embedded case-study approach, we analyze the interplay between top-down control exerted by platform owners and the bottom-up self-organization of complementors in two enterprise software platform ecosystems. Our findings identify three distinct interaction modes—mandated, supported, and autonomous self-organization—each presenting hierarchical trade-offs between platform owner control and complementor autonomy. Our findings extend the prevalent owner-centric theory of platform governance by highlighting the significant impact of bottom-up self-organization on the governance and evolution of DPEs. We propose an integrated theory that accommodates these new dynamics, suggesting soft power as an effective governance mechanism. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the complexities in governing DPEs and offers practical insights for managing top-down control and bottom-up self-organization in the evolving landscape of enterprise software DPEs."
Augmented Reality at Work: Attention Management and Its Impact on Work Performance,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/10,"Augmented reality (AR) is rapidly emerging as a transformative display technology, blending computer-generated content with the real-world environment in real time. Using divided attention theory, this study investigates how different information delivery channels (i.e., AR vs. mobile phone) and the nature of information (i.e., dependence on specific physical context and complexity) affect work performance. A field experiment in the aircraft maintenance context demonstrates that the effect on work performance of providing information via AR vs. a mobile phone is mediated by work attentiveness. The findings reveal that the effectiveness of AR is particularly pronounced when information is highly dependent on the specific physical context but diminishes when information complexity is high. This research deepens our understanding of how presenting information directly in front of users’ eyes (i.e., via AR) affects their attention management and work performance. The findings have significant implications for firms in terms of how to leverage AR to enhance work performance in industrial settings."
Breached and Denied: The Cost of Data Breaches on Individuals as Mortgage Application Denials,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/7,"While a large body of information systems (IS) literature has investigated the antecedents and consequences of data breaches in organizations, we do not have a good understanding of whether a data breach has a material impact on individuals whose private information is compromised and how much damage it causes. We overcome empirical challenges in investigating the impact of data breaches on individual victims by utilizing a unique natural experimental setting that allows us to credibly identify treated and controlled populations—the breach of South Carolina (SC) taxpayer records in 2012. With residents in SC as the treatment group and those in Georgia and North Carolina as the control group, our difference-in-differences estimations find that after the breach at the SC Department of Revenue, there was a significant increase in denials to SC residents’ residential mortgage applications for refinance and home improvement. We also find that the adverse impact of the breach was more profound for Black and Hispanic residents. Our study provides significant theoretical and policy implications with respect to the harm and costs of a large-scale data breach."
Popularity Feedback and Adaptation Strategies in Online Dating: A Social Comparison Perspective,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/9,"Digital platforms are increasingly employing informational nudges to motivate user participation. This paper examines the provision of popularity information as a feedback mechanism and its impact on users’ adaptation strategies. Leveraging ego utility theory and self-determination theory, we hypothesize that comparative popularity information—information that facilitates social comparison—will trigger different reactions based on gender and popularity level. In collaboration with an online dating service provider, we designed and conducted two randomized field experiments in which we provided popularity feedback to platform users and investigated their post-feedback behavioral changes in two adaptation strategies: the selectiveness in choosing potential partners (i.e., selectivity calibration) and the frequency of their online profile modifications (i.e., self-marketing). In the first experiment, where we revealed information about their popularity relative to other users, we found that those who received low-popularity feedback significantly increased self-marketing efforts and lowered their selectivity, but the opposite was observed in individuals who received high-popularity feedback. We also found that men readily made adaptations to their selectivity calibration and self-marketing, whereas women’s behaviors were more persistent as they exhibited little strategic change. We then conducted a second experiment in which we revealed absolute popularity instead of comparative popularity and observed no significant changes in adaptation strategies. Comparing the outcomes of the two experiments, we argue that it is the social comparison information associated with comparative popularity that drives user behavioral changes."
Do Crowds Validate False Data? Systematic Distortion and Affective Polarization,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/18,"This research note examines how sociocognitive influences can systematically distort crowdsourced ground truth in event-centric data through subgroups. The “wisdom of the crowd” is based on the assumption that consensus drives accuracy. While existing research addresses the tendencies of the overall crowd, this research note shows that identifiable subgroups within the crowd can systematically influence crowdsource validation. We conducted an immersive experiment to investigate whether crowd consensus can be systematically distorted by subgroup-based sociocognitive influences, such as affective polarization. In the experiment, raters from a range of subgroups with varying levels of affective polarization were asked to view and validate crisis data from a violent public riot in the year 2020. Relying in part on double debiased machine learning techniques, we analyzed heterogeneous treatment effects across subgroups. The results show that affective polarization and more extreme raters, via the constructs of loyalty and betrayal, distort consensus-based ground truth in different ways. This research note demonstrates how subgroup-based sociocognitive influences can systematically distort the results of consensus-based crowdsourced validation. Additionally, it provides guidance for research and practice on how to account for identifiable subgroups in the crowd. These findings challenge key assumptions about the wisdom of crowds and the accuracy of crowdsourced ground truth in event-centric situations."
Design Principles for Information Categorization Quality in Crowdsourced Crisis Mapping Platforms,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/18,"Crisis mapping platforms have transformed disaster management and digital humanitarian efforts by allowing victims to quickly submit “Requests for Help” (RFH) messages directly from disaster locations via mobile devices. On these platforms, online volunteers are often engaged in processing and categorizing messy and incomplete RFH messages into structured and useful crisis reports that can aid first responders in their recovery efforts. This research note examines the case of the Ushahidi platform deployed during the 2010 Haiti Earthquake to propose design principles for a crisis mapping platform that facilitates the conversion and categorization of victim-submitted RFH messages into actionable crisis reports for on-site first responders. To validate the proposed design principles, we instantiated them with the help of a template, and conducted a series of experiments to confirm the effectiveness of the template in improving the categorization quality of crisis reports. We expect that the design principles will be particularly useful for developing digital platforms aimed at humanitarian crisis response that requires a large-scale participation of online crowd volunteers."
Understanding the Effectiveness of Rewarding Recipients on Online Referral Behavior,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/8,"Online referral programs predominantly focus on incentivizing referrers to make referrals but largely ignore the potential of rewarding recipients to motivate referral behaviors. In this paper, we systematically examine whether, how, and when rewarding recipients could effectively motivate referrers with five experiments across a variety of settings. The results demonstrate that rewarding recipients is effective in motivating referrers to behave prosocially and make referrals. Interestingly, referrers behave prosocially when they are not rewarded, but the effectiveness of rewarding recipients is reduced if referrers are rewarded. We also reveal that referrers’ prosocial behaviors are primarily driven by altruistic motivation, rather than the pursuit of either reputational or collective benefits; notably, offering rewards to referrers dampens their altruistic motivation. Finally, we find that referrers’ prosocial behaviors are inhibited with an increased action cost of their referral behaviors, while their prosocial behaviors persist, even with an increased interpersonal cost associated with the referral behaviors. We conclude by offering theoretical and managerial implications for designing effective referral strategies that leverage the potential of rewarding recipients."

The Complementor’s Dilemma: Navigating Growth Ambitions and the Dependency on Focal Actors in Platform Ecosystems,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/14,"The literature on platform ecosystems increasingly recognizes that nonfocal actors such as complementors may have growth ambitions. Such ambitions, if successfully advanced, may even elevate the complementor’s position in the platform ecosystem to that of a focal actor. However, transitioning from nonfocal actor to focal actor is challenging. Along the way, the nonfocal actor may need to choose between the seemingly unfavorable alternatives of acting on its growth ambitions—risking losing the focal actors’ support needed for that growth—or relinquishing its ambitions to ensure the support of the focal actors continues. Referring to this phenomenon as the complementor’s dilemma, we unpack the process whereby a nonfocal actor can pursue growth ambitions while successfully managing relationships with the focal platforms in the ecosystem. To address this research problem, we conducted an in-depth, embedded case study of a Chinese short-form video platform, Douyin (known as TikTok outside of China), from its inception as a complement in 2016 to its establishment as a focal actor in 2018. During this two-year period, Douyin grew spectacularly from 0.75 million to 208.28 million users. We examined the process through which Douyin navigated the complementor’s dilemma multiple times within the confines of its dependency on Weibo and WeChat, the focal actors in China’s social network platform ecosystem. We contribute to the platform ecosystem literature by offering a process perspective that conceptualizes the complementor’s dilemma and theorizes how to navigate the dilemma when transitioning from a nonfocal actor to a focal actor in a platform ecosystem."
Dancing to the #Challenge: The Effect of TikTok on Closing the Artist Gender Gap in the Music Industry,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/6,"This study investigates how “Hashtag Dance Challenges” (HDCs), a phenomenon popularized on the short-video platform TikTok, are instrumental in helping music artists gain traction in the digital music marketplace. HDCs represent an appealing combination of music and dance, designed to engage users and achieve virality, thereby benefiting artists whose music is featured. This research focuses on how HDCs contribute to the success of women artists, as compared to men, in an industry known for its diversity but challenged by gender inclusivity. We apply role congruity theory to posit that women artists are in a better position to derive benefits from being featured on HDCs, relative to male artists, particularly in cases of gender concordance—when both the creator and the artist are women. We measure the benefits of HDCs using daily changes in the artist’s followership on Spotify, a leading music streaming service, and test our hypotheses using song and artist-level data collected from Spotify and TikTok. We found that artists featured in a new HDC achieve a significant increase in followership on Spotify, relative to similar artists not featured in an HDC. Further, we observed that women creators drive this effect, enhancing the daily growth of Spotify followers by approximately 3% more for women artists, underscoring the value of gender concordance. Our findings shed light on the role of short videos, especially through the vehicle of HDCs, in advancing women artists, while also promoting inclusivity within the digital music industry."
Social Norm Awareness and Norm Compliance in Online Games,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/10,"Online games are one of the most popular information systems in the world, with over 2 billion users worldwide. Most users follow the social norms and standards of behavior in online games, but some violate social norms, negatively affecting others’ gameplay experiences and weakening loyalty to the game. The social norms in games and other online environments often differ from the social norms in the real world, so are users who violate norms doing so deliberately or are they unaware of the norms? Our results suggest that many users violate social norms because they do not understand them—about a third of the 1,093 participants in our study reported being unsure of the social norms in an online game they played regularly. Greater experience with a game did not significantly increase social norm awareness. Instead, perceptions of social presence, and learning routines (i.e., community learning and instructional support) influenced social norm awareness, which in turn influenced norm compliance. Thus, a technology’s social affordances, social presence, and learning routines are more important than experience using a technology for helping users become aware of and comply with social norms."
An Empirical Study of Strategic Opacity in Crowdsourced Evaluations,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/18,"Crowd-voting mechanisms are commonly used to implement scalable evaluations of crowdsourced creative submissions. Unfortunately, the use of crowd-voting also raises the potential for gaming and manipulation. Manipulation is problematic because (1) submitters’ motivation depends on their belief that the system is meritocratic, and (2) manipulated feedback may undermine learning, as submitters seek to learn from received evaluations and those of peers. In this work, we consider a design approach to addressing the issue, focusing on the notion of strategic opacity, i.e., purposefully obfuscating evaluation procedures. On the one hand, opacity may reduce the incentive and thus the prevalence of vote manipulation, and submitters may instead dedicate that time and effort to improving their submission quantity or quality. On the other hand, because opacity makes it difficult for submitters to discern the returns to legitimate effort, submitters may also reduce their submission effort or simply exit the market. We explored this tension via a multimethod study employing field experiments at 99designs and a controlled experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We observed consistent results across all experiments: opacity leads to reductions in gaming in these crowdsourcing contests and significant increases in the allocation of effort toward legitimate vs. illegitimate activities, with no discernible influence on contest participation. We discuss boundary conditions and the implications for contest organizers and contest platform operators."
Taming Complexity in the Cybersecurity of Multihospital Systems: The Role of Enterprise-Wide Data Analytics Platforms,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/14,"A widely accepted notion in cybersecurity practice and research posits that complexity is detrimental to cybersecurity. While this notion mainly focuses on IT, the prevalence of complexity extends beyond IT into organizational domains. Whether the assertion that complexity is detrimental to cybersecurity holds true when applied to organizational domains remains largely unexplored. Moreover, “complexity” and “complicatedness” are often used interchangeably to refer to a large number of interconnected components. We build on complexity science to distinguish the two terms: complexity arises from ad hoc, nonlinear interactions among interconnected components, whereas complicatedness arises from structured, linear interactions. The field lacks sufficient understanding of these distinctions and their implications for cybersecurity risks and mitigations. We theorize how an organization’s complicatedness and complexity in both IT and organizational domains influence cybersecurity breaches. Our context of empirical inquiry is multihospital systems (MHSs), a complex organizational form that uses IT in complex ways. Drawing on complexity science, we posit that complicatedness in medical services, health IT, and the governance arrangements of an MHS increases cybersecurity breaches. We also posit that using enterprise-wide data analytics platforms (EWDAPs) to structure and control ad hoc information sharing practices of the complicated units can reduce breaches despite adding more technology components and dependencies to enterprise IT. We tested these ideas in a sample of 445 MHSs in the U.S. spanning from 2009 to 2017. Complicatedness in medical services, health IT, and governance stands out as the primary contributor to cybersecurity breaches in MHSs. Ad hoc, nonlinear interactions contribute to complexity and exacerbate the cybersecurity breach effects of complicatedness. In contrast, structured interactions, exemplified by patient data sharing through an EWDAP, achieve simplification and mitigate the cybersecurity breaches associated with complicatedness."

"Causal Inference Grounded in Causal Diagrams: Benefits, Limitations, and Opportunities for the Information Systems Field",https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/5,"We join the important effort of embracing diverse views on causality reflected in a prior MIS Quarterly Editor’s Comment (Mithas et al., 2022b). Specifically, we aim to expand the discussion around a major causal framework and toolkit that, we believe, is largely missing and needed in empirical studies in the field of information systems: that of causal diagrams and structural causal modeling (SCM). Being relatively new, the SCM framework has faced resistance from economists that has only recently begun to soften and, for this reason, remains largely absent in econometrics textbooks and in the curriculum of most information systems PhD programs. In contrast to viewpoints emphasizing the dichotomy between SCM and econometrics or potential outcomes approaches, we explain how SCM can serve as a complementary layer of identification and communication that aligns with such proven design and analysis frameworks. We discuss the current limitations of the SCM framework and opportunities for new research."
Find the Good. Seek the Unity: A Hidden Markov Model of Human-AI Delegation Dynamics,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/17,"As AI becomes integral to enterprise decision-making, this study explores the collaborative dynamics between managers and AI systems, focusing on human willingness to delegate tasks to AI. Grounded in the “agentic” systems delegation framework and instance-based learning theory, we employed a hidden Markov model in a longitudinal study of the dynamic delegation decision-making process involving 875 store managers. We found that there is a potential polarization in managers’ delegation willingness, with managers who recognize the capability of AI exhibiting high delegation willingness and fostering increased collaboration with AI over time—in contrast to their counterparts who are inclined to reduce AI’s involvement. During human-AI interactions, managers’ continuous performance appraisal of AI shapes their dynamic delegation willingness, which in turn affects their assessment of AI capability. This process forms a delegation feedback loop that drives the dynamics of delegation behaviors. Our study indicates that managers with a high willingness to delegate tend to outperform their counterparts and offers valuable insights for human-AI collaborative intelligence in organizational settings."

Emergence of IT Implementation Consequences in Organizations: An Assemblage Approach,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/13,"Ex nihilo nihil fit—nothing comes from nothing—fundamentally challenges IS scholars to explain how a new behavior may emerge and evolve into a recognizable practice from an organization’s IT implementation processes. Prior research addressing this problem has ascribed consequences to a preexisting macrolevel structure or microlevel interactions. We examined this issue by conceptualizing the emergence of IT implementation consequences as a multiphased process with analytically disaggregated phases. Using an assemblage lens, our theorizing draws on data from a multisite case study of body-worn camera technology implementation in three municipal police organizations in the U.S. We identified three emergence phases—individuation, composition, and actualization—and developed a process model theorizing a path from material and expressive components to IT implementation consequences through cascading properties and capacities. Our model shows that the emergence of IT implementation consequences is nonlinear and involves feedback loops across multiple phases. In some instances, IT implementation consequences may emerge via negative feedback loops involving tweaks and course correction before converging into recognizable new practices. In other instances, they may fail or convergence into recognizable practices may be delayed. We also show how combining existing components and assemblages results in nesting assemblages at successively larger scales. This allowed us to relativize the micro-macro relationship and explain both top-down and bottom-up emergence of IT implementation consequences."
"Ruckus in the Rentals, Seeking New Arrangements: Remedying the Impact of Home-Sharing on Urban Noise",https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/20,"Drawing underutilized residential assets into the tourism economy, home-sharing platforms create tremendous economic value for their owners and users. They also, however, generate negative externalities. This study examines the impact of home-sharing property use on an externality that has been increasingly understood to have adverse consequences for human health and well-being—noise. Based on empirical analyses using a large sample of transactions from a popular platform, we show that property use increases noise, which adversely affects neighbors. More interestingly, we show that the increase in noise is mitigated when property use is spatially or temporally concentrated. Our analyses reveal that a high concentration of property use can enhance the effectiveness of deterrence created through enforcement action against noise complaints. We further conduct empirically informed simulation experiments and propose a nudging algorithm that helps platforms mitigate noise externalities while also fulfilling user preferences and maintaining revenue growth. Contributing to the burgeoning literature on platform externalities, our work highlights the need for further research on potential complementarities between platform and regulatory governance and provides platforms with an alternative approach to the reputationally expensive guest penalties for addressing noise externalities."
Does Ransomware Make Investors “WannaCry”? On Investors’ Divergent Reactions to Ransomware Hits and Near Misses,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/15,"In recent years, ransomware has become one of the most dangerous cyber threats, with successful attacks causing severe operational disruptions and staggering damages. Rationally speaking, investors should react negatively to firms’ ransomware disclosures, but this may not always be the case. Based on norm theory, we describe a paradoxical phenomenon wherein investors exhibit negative reactions to ransomware hits (i.e., events that led to operational disruptions) but positive reactions to near misses (i.e., events in which operational disruptions were narrowly avoided). The positive reactions occur due to an outcome bias in which near-miss events—events that are objectively negative but less severe than expected—are viewed positively instead of negatively. We tested these predictions by reporting on an investigation of stock market reactions to disclosures of ransomware hits vs. near misses. To do so, we assembled a comprehensive dataset of ransomware incidents disclosed by U.S. public firms. Using the event study method, we estimated abnormal stock market returns and found evidence in support of our predictions. First, in line with expectations, ransomware hits that led to the expected severe impact resulted in stock price drops of -4.40%. However, near misses, where disruptions were avoided, were rewarded with gains of 2.87%, confirming positive instead of negative reactions. This offers new insights into investors’ biased responses to certain cybersecurity incidents. These positive reactions, however, represent a call for caution because, albeit seemingly favorable, they mask underlying risks."
Ruptures During IT-enabled Change: A Sensemaking and Imbrication Analysis,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/7,"Focusing on imbrication change as conducted by designers during design and development, we undertook a 2.5-year long case study to examine how 10 hospitals configured technology and planned routine changes as they sought to transform their organizations. Our observations revealed a phenomenon we call ruptures, defined as situations that occur due to breakdowns in the process of IT-enabled change. Ruptures allow us to unpack the temporal process of identifying and resolving instances of disruptive problems during IT-enabled change. Our analysis of ruptures in this context expands the theory of imbrication to account for the role of designers. We demonstrate that three imbrication types—historical, envisioned, and realized—exist cognitively during design and influence the design process. Our results demonstrate how problems arise, how dynamic change unfolds through sensemaking, and how fractal, embedded, imbrications complicate the IT-enabled change process."
The Dark Side of Voluntary Data Sharing,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/10,"To balance the need for privacy and the benefits of big data analytics, regulators around the world are giving consumers control over their data, allowing them to choose whether or not to voluntarily share their purchase history data with firms. Intuition suggests that voluntary data sharing benefits consumers who can now choose to share their data only when it is profitable to do so. To investigate this argument, we built a model in which a monopolistic firm sells a repeatedly purchased product to consumers over two periods, and consumers decide whether or not to share their purchase history data with the firm, who can use it in the future to price-discriminate against them. We found that, compared to when data collection is completely outlawed, voluntary data sharing can benefit the firm but at the consumer’s expense. Moreover, regulations that mandate firms to better protect consumer data against data breaches can backfire on consumers. Finally, we show that under voluntary data sharing, a firm’s ability to offer consumers a monetary incentive to share their data can improve profits without hurting consumers. Taken together, these findings underscore the surprising effects of voluntary data sharing and caution public policymakers of how certain data policies that, on the surface, seem purely beneficial can lead to unintended consequences."
Do Digital Platforms Improve the Performance of Nonbinding Contracts? Evidence from the Amazon Freight Platform,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/7,"This research examines how digital platforms influence the performance of nonbinding contracts. Businesses in many industries with high uncertainty, such as trucking freight and construction, simultaneously use nonbinding contracts, which impose no legal sanctions for refusals, and spot markets, which facilitate real-time, flexible transactions with market-determined prices. Understanding the conditions under which nonbinding contracts perform is a major concern in these industries. Leveraging the entry of the Amazon Freight platform in the trucking freight industry, we demonstrate that adding a digital platform-enabled spot marketplace improves the performance of nonbinding contracts. We identified several mechanisms driving this effect: (1) expanding carriers’ transportation capacity, (2) lowering spot market prices, and (3) reducing shippers’ reliance on nonbinding contracts for shorter-haul truckloads. Moreover, the digital platform’s impact on enhancing nonbinding contract performance is particularly pronounced in markets with volatile demand and shorter hauls. This research contributes to understanding the impacts of digital platforms in highly uncertain industries that simultaneously use nonbinding contracts and spot markets. Our findings provide implications to policymakers and business managers on leveraging digital platforms to improve operational efficiency in highly uncertain industries."
