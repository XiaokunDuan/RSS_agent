JMIS,2025,Orchestrating Digital Resilience: A Clinical IS Study of an Everything-as-a-Service Technology Strategy,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2435975,"Organisations must build digital resilience to effectively safeguard their business operations against environmental, economic, or socio-political disruptions. One approach involvesadaptation– using Information Technology (IT) to design business operations that can withstand and recover from such disruptions. A second approach involvesmitigation– using IT to advance environmental, social, or economic objectives that reduce the root causes and likelihood of future disruptions. However, both approaches to building digital resilience are challenging to implement. Our clinical Information Systems (IS) research article examines and reflects on how Beta Bank, an Australian fintech firm, developed an Everything-as-a-Service (EaaS) technology strategy and achieved digital resilience throughout its business operations. We explain how Beta Bank strategically leveraged EaaS to adapt to the significant disruptions caused by the Australian wildfire disaster and the global COVID pandemic of 2019–2021. We then unpack how Beta Bank further leveraged EaaS to enhance its digital resilience via a mitigation approach. Our work delineates a typology of four EaaS pathways for pursuing digital resilience, discusses the scholarly implications of EaaS as a future IS research area, and provides actionable managerial guidance through an EaaS roadmap, a strategic planning tool for those aiming to implement and benefit from this technology strategy."
JMIS,2025,Responsible social media use: how user characteristics shape the actualisation of ambiguous affordances,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2444249,"Social media’s dual role as a source of both societal benefits and harms poses significant challenges to its responsible use. While existing literature primarily focuses on organisational and regulatory responsibilities, it sometimes overlooks individual user responsibility. This paper develops a theoretical framework that suggests user characteristics – specifically, conscientiousness and moral tolerance – are key moderators in the responsible (or irresponsible) actualisation of social media’s ambiguous affordances. Grounded in virtue ethics, the framework maintains that four archetypal user characters – narcissist, dogmatist, nihilist, and altruist – shape how social media affordances are actualised. Our work contributes to the Information Systems (IS) literature by adding a nuanced understanding of how responsible use shapes and is shaped by social media users and the sociotechnical context. The framework offers a basis for future research to examine the interaction between user characteristics, affordance ambiguity, and responsible social media use, underscoring the need for technocentric and sociocentric design interventions to promote responsible use."
JMIS,2025,Data spaces as meta-organisations,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2025.2451250,"Sharing and reusing data across organisations is central to the European data strategy and its transformation towards creating a data-driven economy. Currently, data sharing, when it occurs, is typically facilitated through centralised platforms or bilateral integration solutions, which are increasingly failing to meet requirements for flexibility, trustworthiness, and self-determination over shared data. Data spaces have emerged as a promising solution, built on distributed and shared infrastructure and governance frameworks. However, widespread adoption requires consensus on the necessary organisational and technical capabilities. This paper proposes a data service model and design principles for data services to clarify choices and guide decision-making. We adopt a novel perspective by conceptualising data spaces as meta-organisations to guide an Action Design Research study, utilising privileged access to key large-scale European data space projects in the mobility and automotive sectors. This paper not only develops a nascent design theory for data spaces, but also offers a practical framework, breaking down complex challenges into actionable, scientifically validated components – for further growth and adoption of data spaces."
JMIS,2025,Designing an immersive virtual reality artefact for disability inclusion: an action design research,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2025.2460805,"People with disabilities (PWD) often face social barriers, such as inaccessible environments, public misunderstandings, and stereotypes, which lead to their exclusion from societal activities. To address this issue, we collaborated with a disability research institute to carry out an action design research (ADR) project aimed at designing an immersive virtual reality (IVR) artefact to cultivate public awareness of the social barriers faced by PWD and foster inclusive attitudes and behaviours towards them. Using technology affordance as a lens, this study went through four interwoven ADR stages to co-design and refine the IVR artefact with researchers, disability groups, IVR and media experts, and end users representing the public. Reflecting on this design process, we distilled our learnings into four design principles to prescribe what and how to craft IVR artefacts for fostering disability inclusion. These principles can guide researchers and practitioners in developing similar IVR artefacts to help address similar problems. Our co-design process, which involved PWDs, enhances the existing understanding and practice of socially inclusive design-oriented research by providing empirical evidence of working with marginalised groups in developing emerging technology artefacts."
JMIS,2025,The Insider’s Dilemma: Employed Open Source Developers’ Identification Imbalance and Intentions to Leave,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2025.2463984,"In corporate-sponsored open source software development, company-employed developers become “insiders” to the OSS community, and therefore have two roles: they serve as a representative of their employing company, but may also identify as a member of the open source community. This study investigates what happens when identification with the company exceeds identification with the community (and vice versa), and also focuses on consequences when these insider roles come in conflict. Informed by social identity theory and organization-profession conflict theory, we report on two studies that predict identification imbalance to affect company turnover intention. Our first study is based on a survey of employed Linux kernel developers and uses polynomial regression to assess the effect of identification imbalance (and congruence) on company turnover intention. The second study extends our investigation beyond Linux and demonstrates that the effect of identification imbalance on turnover intention is mediated by role conflict. The findings suggest that turnover intention is lowest, when company and community identification match at high rather than low levels. We also find developers’ company career ambition influences how role conflict relates to company turnover intention. This study holds implications for theory and for managers in companies who engage with OSS communities."
JMIS,2025,Impact of rounded rating display and confidence cues on the subsequent reviews,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2025.2471074,"Online review platforms frequently use rounded rating displays, rounding average ratings to the nearest half-star for simplicity. However, such practice can misguide consumers by creating discrepancies between displayed ratings and actual quality. For example, providers with nearly identical average ratings (e.g. 4.25 and 4.26) might be displayed as 4 and 4.5 stars, respectively, while significantly different providers (e.g. 3.76 and 4.25) might both appear as 4 stars. Such rounding misguides consumers’ pre-purchase expectations and can negatively influence post-purchase satisfaction when consumers’ experiences fail to match expectations. Despite the prevalence of rounded rating displays, their impact on subsequent review behavior remains underexplored. Using a regression discontinuity design and a controlled experiment, we investigate how rounded rating displays influence review generation. Our findings reveal that ratings rounded up (compared to rounded down) prompt consumers to leave reviews with lower ratings and less positive but more negative sentiments. Furthermore, lower rating dispersion and higher information diversity intensify these effects by strengthening consumers’ confidence on pre-purchase expectations. This study underscores the significant role of design features, such as rounded rating displays, in shaping review behavior, providing valuable insights for platform designers seeking to mitigate unintended consequences and improve the way platforms present information."
JMIS,2025,Online virtual consultation between patients and physicians as interactive affordance,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2025.2473950,"While healthcare providers have widely adopted digital health platforms for patient online virtual consultations, organizations are challenged by difficulties in utilizing them for effective physician–patient interactions. This study investigates online virtual consultations between physicians and patients enabled by their joint use of mobile social media technology. Based on affordance theory, we propose a new type of group-level affordance,interactive affordance, characterized by interactions between users with different predefined roles and varying preferences. We conceptualize interactive affordance as a second-order construct and propose the structure of interactive affordance that is affected by dyadic alignment and individual user affordances, influenced by three determinants (relative advantage, process standardization, and absorptive capacity). The interactive affordance affects two outcomes (physician and patient satisfaction). These relationships were tested using survey data collected from physicians and patients. The results show that interactive affordance actualization is affected by the dyadic alignments of their determinants, and it improves physician satisfaction. This study contributes to the affordance literature by proposing a new type of affordance, interactive affordance. It contributes to the literature on digital health technology used by users with differing preferences by showing the effects of dyadic alignment on the shared use of collaboration technology."
JMIS,2025,A field experiment on ISP training designs for enhancing employee information security compliance,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2359460,"Information security policy (ISP) training plays an important role in enhancing organisational resilience against cyber threats by providing employees with the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively identify, prevent, and respond to security breaches. This research aims to explore how the use of deterrence arguments and threat arguments can enhance the effectiveness of ISP training. We theorise how ISP training affects employees’ ISP compliance behaviour by arguing for a transfer of training lens to study the effectiveness of ISP training. The results of our field experiment with triangulated data suggest that the effect of argumentative-enhanced ISP training is twofold. First, employees who participated in enhanced training sessions with deterrence and threat arguments demonstrated superior training outputs after the training, which, in turn, translated into a sustained training outcome three weeks after the training. Second, we also find evidence that threat arguments can reinforce the application of training outputs in the maintenance stage of learned behaviours. With this applied research study, we contribute to the research and practice by providing empirical evidence of the effectiveness of ISP training designs."
JMIS,2025,The co-evolution of contract and software artefact in cloudsourcing,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2380707,"Propelled by the promise of cost savings and enhanced service quality, cloudsourcing has become the largest segment of the global outsourcing market. In practice, however, managing cloudsourcing projects is notoriously challenging because they morph into complex, multi-year endeavours that entail frequent adaptations of both the cloud service and the contract in response to emergent goals. This study develops and explores the idea that in this adaptation process, the outsourcing contract and software artefact become closely connected. When making contracting decisions, clients must consider that cloud services are built on standardised multi-tenant architectures, offer predefined customisation options, and evolve continuously. Therefore, we explore the dynamic interplay between contract and cloud-based software artefact in response to emergent goals. Drawing from a longitudinal study of four cloudsourcing cases, we reveal two patterns: co-evolutionary polarisation and co-evolutionary harmonisation. The former, driven by positive reinforcement, intensifies tensions between initial and emergent goals, manifesting in projects drifting away from goals. The latter, characterised by balancing feedback, facilitates a flexible trajectory, enabling stepwise reconciliation of initial and emergent goals. These findings offer significant theoretical contributions to the management of sourcing projects, especially in cloud contexts, and provide actionable insights for managers navigating the complex dynamics of cloudsourcing."
JMIS,2025,Achieving strategic alignment between business and information technology with information technology governance: the role of commitment to principles and Top Leadership Support,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2390998,"IT governance (ITG) is crucial in achieving IT strategic alignment, but many organizations find this to be an elusive goal. We thus expand ITG into two components: ITG mechanisms and ITG principles. We propose that beyond the mere option of ITG mechanisms, organizations must fully embrace the broader “spirit” of ITG, which occurs when an organization is committed to ITG principles coupled with top leadership support. To test our theorization, we first developed and validated two new measures. We used the ITG framework of COBIT to create a measure of commitment to COBIT principles (CCP), and we found that CCP fully mediates ITG mechanisms’ relationship with strategic alignment. We thus illuminate a missing link between adopting ITG mechanisms and achieving strategic alignment by demonstrating the need to focus on ITG principles. We show that top leadership support for IT, including support at the board level, not only enhances CCP but also directly contributes to improved strategic alignment. Our study establishes that adopting ITG mechanisms is necessary but insufficient for achieving strategic alignment. Effective organizations go beyond implementing isolated ITG mechanisms; they fully embrace integrated COBIT-based principles, guided by a strong infusion of top leadership support, including board-level support."
JMIS,2025,Reducing the incidence of biased algorithmic decisions through feature importance transparency: an empirical study,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2395531,"As firms move towards data-driven decision-making using algorithmic systems, concerns are raised regarding the lack of transparency of these systems which could have ramifications related to users’ trust and the potential for provoking discriminatory decisions. Although previous research has developed methods to improve algorithmic transparency, little empirical evidence exists regarding the extent of the effectiveness of these approaches. Drawing upon Rest’s theory of ethical decision-making and the literature on algorithmic transparency and bias, we investigate the effectiveness of feature importance (FI), a common transparency-enhancing approach, which illustrates the nature and the weights of the features utilised by an algorithm. Through an online experiment employing a fictitious tool that provided recommendations for selecting employees for a promotion-related training programme, we find that FI is effective when biased recommendations include direct discrimination (i.e. when individuals are treated less favourably on protected grounds such as gender); but is of little assistance when discrimination is indirect (i.e. when a criterion or practice that is apparently neutral, disadvantages a group of individuals who are of a protected class). Additionally, we propose a new transparency approach, using aggregated demographic information, to accompany FI in indirect discrimination circumstances and report the results of testing its effects."
JMIS,2025,Examining the impact of mobile gambling harm minimisation features: a dualistic model of passion perspective,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2396964,"Driven by the ubiquity of smartphones, sports gambling has intensified globally. Most mobile gambling apps are mandated to offer harm minimisation features which are IT tools designed to help prevent harmful gambling activity. Existing research on the effectiveness of gambling harm minimisation features often overlooks the fact that individuals engage with multiple IT tools to varying extents to achieve a single goal. As an initial step, and to reflect actual user engagement, we conduct an exploratory factor analysis on a range of opt-in harm minimisation features. Next, aligned with the dualistic model of passion, we theorise and empirical test how direct and indirect harm minimisation features moderate the translation of different passions for mobile gambling into the well-being outcome of subjective vitality. Our findings suggest that indirect harm minimisation features, but not direct features, are effective in protecting the well-being of obsessively passionate mobile gamblers. For harmoniously passionate mobile gamblers, the opposite situation holds – direct harm minimisation features strengthen the effect of a harmonious passion on vitality whereas indirect features have no significant effect."
JMIS,2025,Determinants of gamification effectiveness: perspectives of technology affordances and coping responses in the context of team-based gamified training,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2398600,"Firms face significant challenges in effectively training employees in adopting complex information systems, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP). Gamified training has emerged as a promising means to address these challenges. Despite this, prior research has paid little attention to the factors affecting the effective use of gamified training. This study aims to identify the determinants of the effective use of gamified training. Based on technology affordances, coping, and gamification literature, the study proposes that team-based gamification affordances (e.g. collaboration and competition affordances) affect coping responses (e.g. task-focused, emotion-focused, and avoidance coping), leading to effective use. We utilized the ERP simulation game to empirically test the research model, employing a multi-study approach comprising two studies (Study 1 = 255 participants, Study 2 = 219 participants). Structural equation modelling was used for data analysis. Our results indicate that collaboration affordance significantly affects task-focused, emotion-focused, and avoidance coping. However, competition affordance influenced only task-focused coping. We also found that task-focused and emotion-focused coping affected effective use. This study contributes to IS literature by highlighting gamification affordances and coping responses as important predictors of effective use in gamified training, leading organizations and IS scholars to design impactful and engaging gamified training programmes."
JMIS,2025,Unveiling motivational configurations in shaping meaningful engagement in green gamification,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2404968,"Green gamification embeds game elements into non-game green information systems to tackle environmental degradation by encouraging pro-environmental behaviours. However, its real-world impact has been limited by a lack of meaningful engagement among users. To overcome this challenge, it is crucial to promote meaningful engagement through motivations and explore the intricate relationships that underlie them. We propose a configurational model based on self-determination theory to explore how different motivations combine to impact the two meaningful engagement outcomes: experiential outcome (participation for positive experience) and instrumental outcome (participation to fulfil specific tasks). Using a two-wave longitudinal design with both subjective and objective data, we conduct necessary condition analysis and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to identify four configurations that stimulate meaningful engagement. Specifically, the experiential outcome is driven by a combination of high hedonic, high pro-environmental, high social interaction, and low recognition motivations. The instrumental outcome is enhanced by configurations of high intrinsic (hedonic and achievement), low pro-environmental, and high self-expression (or low recognition) motivations. These findings yield four propositions that provide a theoretical foundation for future research and practical insights for designing more effective green gamification applications."
JMIS,2025,From cyber benign to cyber malicious: unveiling the evolution of insider cyber maliciousness from a stage theory perspective,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2413072,"Insider cyber maliciousness presents a significant challenge to organizational security. Existing research has focused on identifying determinants of malicious cyber behavior but has not accounted for the progression insiders go through in arriving at the point where they look to harm their employers. This knowledge gap prevents organizations from potentially derailing acts of cyber maliciousness through timely interventions. Based on interviews with a cross-industry sample of organizational insiders, this study adopts a stage theory development approach to explore the progression of insiders from cyber benign to cyber malicious. Stage theories are useful frameworks that help explain how individuals’ perceptions, emotions, and/or behaviors progress through distinct and qualitatively different stages of development. By uncovering the initial, subsequent, and recurring perceptions and emotions that drive insiders to engage in malicious cyber activities, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the phenomenon. Our findings establish a new basis for understanding insider cyber maliciousness, presenting it as an evolutionary progression. As such, our findings also reorient the focus of malicious insider interventions toward strain-reducing or strain-relieving interventions based on the initial, subsequent, or recurring strain experiences."
JMIS,2025,To learn or not learn from AI? Unpacking the effects of feedback valence on novel insights recall,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2426473,"Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are unique pedagogical agents, in that (1) they can generate novel insights, and (2) they tend to be treated differently by humans, because they are opaquer and more intelligent than traditional technologies. Thus, it is not clear if and how people learn novel insights through AI feedback, and if the learning process and outcomes differ compared to when the source of insights and feedback is humans. Here, we seek to address this gap with four preregistered experiments (totaln=1,766). They use a learning paradigm in which we manipulate the feedback source, feedback valence, and test instructions. The key finding is that people learn novel insights better when they receive negative feedback from AI than from humans. There is no difference in recall for positive feedback. This implies that AI as pedagogical agents are likely to outperform human feedback sources (peers or experts), or at least, be no worse. Our results further reveal that (1) people present typical human-human learning biases when receiving negative feedback from AI, namely mnemic neglect, and (2) ego bruising (as manifested in reduction in state self-esteem) and anger mediate such effects when receiving negative feedback from AI."
MISQ,2025,How Mergers and Acquisitions Increase Data Breaches: A Complexity Perspective,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/13,"This study examines how the mergers and acquisitions (M&As) of a firm influence its number of data breaches. Drawing from complexity theory and matching theory, we propose that M&As increase data breaches and this effect is contingent on M&A diversity (dissimilarity between the parent and target firms). Based on the 18-year panel data (2004-2021) of 5,072 public firms in the United States, we find that more M&As by a firm lead to more data breaches. Moreover, we reveal that the number of data breaches increases even more when the parent and target firms operate in different business domains. This finding is confirmed when we operationalize M&A diversity as size discrepancy or a strategic type difference between the parent firm and the target firm (vertical vs. horizontal M&A). Furthermore, based on routine activity theory, we explore two additional moderating mechanisms through which M&As influence data breaches: M&A media publicity and target vulnerability. Our analyses demonstrate that M&As with higher media publicity experience more data breaches than those with lower media publicity, but counterintuitively, M&As involving a more vulnerable target firm lead to fewer data breaches than those involving a less vulnerable target firm. This study not only confirms the impact of M&As on data breach recurrence but also unveils various underlying mechanisms of this impact, thus contributing to both research and practice in cybersecurity and information systems."

MISQ,2025,“Complexity Is the Worst Enemy of Security”: Studying Cybersecurity Through the Lens Of Organizational Complexity,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/12,"Writing about computer systems twenty-five years ago, Schneier wrote that “the worst enemy of security is complexity” (Schneier, 1999), because complex systems are both easier to attack and harder to secure than simpler ones. In this essay, we provide an overview of Schneier’s complexity principle and provide our observations of how two articles in this issue, Liang et al. (2025) and Tanriverdi et al. (2025), employed this principle in their research. We also offer our ideas for why complexity and cybersecurity are especially amenable for study in the field of information systems and where future research can go from here."
MISQ,2025,Regulating Digital Platform Ecosystems Through Data Sharing and Data Siloing: Consequences for Innovation and Welfare,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/9,"Digital platform ecosystems thrive on their ability to acquire and leverage user data across multiple data-driven services. This enables dominant platforms to harness insights obtained from their primary markets, where user data is collected, thus gaining a competitive advantage in secondary markets, where they exploit this data. While data cross-use brings about efficiencies, policymakers worldwide have expressed concerns about the economic power and the potential distortion of competition and innovation incentives associated with it. To address these concerns, two distinct and targeted policy interventions have been suggested: data siloing, which restricts the cross-use of data within platform ecosystems, and mandated data sharing with competitors. Using an analytical model that examines data cross-use in digital platform ecosystems, we analyzed the impact of data siloing and data sharing obligations, and their interaction on competition, innovation, consumer welfare, and overall social welfare. Our findings indicate that an optimal policy involves data sharing without data siloing, whereas the EU’s Digital Markets Act currently mandates both types of data cross-use regulation."
MISQ,2025,When Algorithms Delegate to Humans: Exploring Human-Algorithm Interaction at Uber,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/16,"Algorithms are increasingly seen as capable of autonomously initiating and managing interactions with humans—for example, through delegating the rights and responsibilities for successful outcomes of shared tasks without human intervention. While research into such interactions primarily focuses on dyadic configurations, complex settings where multiple agents work together have become a nexus of more nuanced interactions that go beyond the dyad. This paper explores such interactions through the lens of delegation by investigating how many algorithms delegate to many humans in a multi-agent setting. Analyzing patent data and interviews with drivers and passengers, we unpack delegation in the context of the ride-hailing application Uber. We theorize distributed delegation as a construct capturing collective hybrid appraisal, collective hybrid distribution, and collective hybrid coordination, in which a collective of algorithms delegates by drawing on inputs from multiple human agents. Our findings highlight that distributed delegation is collective, hybrid, and relational by nature, and demonstrate the extent to which human inputs are necessary for collectives of algorithms to exercise the capacity to delegate. Distributed delegation as a continuum of algorithmic and human involvement poses a challenge for recent theories suggesting the unprecedented autonomy of algorithms from humans."
MISQ,2025,Self-Organization and Governance in Digital Platform Ecosystems: An Information Ecology Approach,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/8,"This research investigates the interplay of top-down control and bottom-up self-organization within digital platform ecosystems (DPEs), focusing on the formation and management of complementor coalitions. Although these coalitions can increase a DPE’s generativity, they can also threaten its integrity. We investigate this tension by employing information ecology (IE) theory, which allows us to examine complementor coalitions as holons that navigate between self-assertiveness and integration within the structural hierarchies of DPEs. Utilizing an inductive, embedded case-study approach, we analyze the interplay between top-down control exerted by platform owners and the bottom-up self-organization of complementors in two enterprise software platform ecosystems. Our findings identify three distinct interaction modes—mandated, supported, and autonomous self-organization—each presenting hierarchical trade-offs between platform owner control and complementor autonomy. Our findings extend the prevalent owner-centric theory of platform governance by highlighting the significant impact of bottom-up self-organization on the governance and evolution of DPEs. We propose an integrated theory that accommodates these new dynamics, suggesting soft power as an effective governance mechanism. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the complexities in governing DPEs and offers practical insights for managing top-down control and bottom-up self-organization in the evolving landscape of enterprise software DPEs."
MISQ,2025,"Ruckus in the Rentals, Seeking New Arrangements: Remedying the Impact of Home-Sharing on Urban Noise",https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/20,"Drawing underutilized residential assets into the tourism economy, home-sharing platforms create tremendous economic value for their owners and users. They also, however, generate negative externalities. This study examines the impact of home-sharing property use on an externality that has been increasingly understood to have adverse consequences for human health and well-being—noise. Based on empirical analyses using a large sample of transactions from a popular platform, we show that property use increases noise, which adversely affects neighbors. More interestingly, we show that the increase in noise is mitigated when property use is spatially or temporally concentrated. Our analyses reveal that a high concentration of property use can enhance the effectiveness of deterrence created through enforcement action against noise complaints. We further conduct empirically informed simulation experiments and propose a nudging algorithm that helps platforms mitigate noise externalities while also fulfilling user preferences and maintaining revenue growth. Contributing to the burgeoning literature on platform externalities, our work highlights the need for further research on potential complementarities between platform and regulatory governance and provides platforms with an alternative approach to the reputationally expensive guest penalties for addressing noise externalities."

MISQ,2025,Regulating Emerging Technologies: Prospective Sensemaking through Abstraction and Elaboration,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/11,"Emerging digital technologies require regulation that will avoid harmful effects but that also, ideally, fosters innovation. We report on a case study of how actors, representing a variety of perspectives (legal, regulatory authority, government, industry, and technology), interacted to construct a law on trustworthy technology in the European state of Liechtenstein. This regulatory construction was enabled by collective prospective sensemaking relying on the interrelated processes of abstraction and elaboration, through which actors collectively reconceptualized the regulatory target in terms of the technology (from blockchain to trustworthy technology), its uses (from cryptocurrency to token economy), and required roles (from financial service provider roles to trustworthy technology systems roles). Abstraction allowed the group of actors to extract and generalize essential properties to support the regulatory goals of technology neutrality and innovation-friendliness. Elaboration allowed the group to identify and specify details and requirements to support the regulatory goals of creating legal certainty and protecting users. Through these processes, actors could construct a shared, collective understanding that accommodated various viewpoints and paved the way for writing a law. From this case study, we develop a theory of collective prospective sensemaking in regulating emerging technologies."
MISQ,2025,Correcting Measurement Error in Regression Models with Variables Constructed from Aggregated Output of Data Mining Models,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/6,"The burgeoning interest in data mining has catalyzed a proliferation of innovative techniques in extracting useful information from unstructured data sources, such as text and images in social sciences. One typical research design involves a two-stage process. In the first stage, researchers apply the classification algorithm to predict an individual-level categorical variable. In the second stage, researchers aggregate the predicted values to construct a group-level variable for further regression analysis. For example, text classification has been applied to classify whether a review is positive or negative. The predicted review sentiment is aggregated at the product level as a focal independent variable in a regression model to examine the impact of the average review sentiment on product sales. Since the first-stage classification will inevitably have errors, the aggregated variable may suffer from a measurement error in the regression analysis. Our study attempts to systematically investigate the theoretical properties of the estimation bias and introduce solutions rooted in theory to mitigate the issue of measurement error. We propose one exact solution and two approximated solutions based on the central limit theorem (CLT) and the law of large numbers (LLN), respectively. Our theoretical analysis and experimentation confirm that the consistency of regression estimators can be recovered across all examined scenarios and the approximated solutions offer a significantly reduced computational complexity compared to the exact solution. We also provide heuristic guidelines to choose one of three solutions."
MISQ,2025,Deliberative or Automatic: Disentangling the Dual Processes Behind the Persuasive Power of Online Word-of-Mouth,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/17,"As online reviews become increasingly indispensable for consumers, they have attracted significant attention from both practitioners and researchers. It is a common belief that the persuasive effect of online reviews involves a deliberative and conscious process. Drawing on dual-process theories and the persuasion literature, we challenge this conventional wisdom, distinguish Type 2 processing (which requires deliberation) and Type 1 processing (which occurs automatically), and disentangle their relative impacts. With a focus on review elaborateness and review exposure, we propose that the automatic process of review exposure may play a greater role than elaborateness in changing consumers’ attitudes and purchase intentions. In addition, in line with the negativity bias, we posit that the persuasive impact of review exposure (vs. elaborateness) is moderated by the valence of highly exposed reviews. The results of the two experiments provide consistent support for these predictions. Our findings complement and extend the emerging literature starting to explore the role of automatic Type 1 processing in consumers’ use of online reviews, reveal the primary driver of persuasion and its boundary condition in online word-of-mouth, and provide important implications for review platforms, product manufacturers, and retailers."
MISQ,2025,Taming Complexity in the Cybersecurity of Multihospital Systems: The Role of Enterprise-Wide Data Analytics Platforms,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/14,"A widely accepted notion in cybersecurity practice and research posits that complexity is detrimental to cybersecurity. While this notion mainly focuses on IT, the prevalence of complexity extends beyond IT into organizational domains. Whether the assertion that complexity is detrimental to cybersecurity holds true when applied to organizational domains remains largely unexplored. Moreover, “complexity” and “complicatedness” are often used interchangeably to refer to a large number of interconnected components. We build on complexity science to distinguish the two terms: complexity arises from ad hoc, nonlinear interactions among interconnected components, whereas complicatedness arises from structured, linear interactions. The field lacks sufficient understanding of these distinctions and their implications for cybersecurity risks and mitigations. We theorize how an organization’s complicatedness and complexity in both IT and organizational domains influence cybersecurity breaches. Our context of empirical inquiry is multihospital systems (MHSs), a complex organizational form that uses IT in complex ways. Drawing on complexity science, we posit that complicatedness in medical services, health IT, and the governance arrangements of an MHS increases cybersecurity breaches. We also posit that using enterprise-wide data analytics platforms (EWDAPs) to structure and control ad hoc information sharing practices of the complicated units can reduce breaches despite adding more technology components and dependencies to enterprise IT. We tested these ideas in a sample of 445 MHSs in the U.S. spanning from 2009 to 2017. Complicatedness in medical services, health IT, and governance stands out as the primary contributor to cybersecurity breaches in MHSs. Ad hoc, nonlinear interactions contribute to complexity and exacerbate the cybersecurity breach effects of complicatedness. In contrast, structured interactions, exemplified by patient data sharing through an EWDAP, achieve simplification and mitigate the cybersecurity breaches associated with complicatedness."
MISQ,2025,The Dark Side of Voluntary Data Sharing,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/10,"To balance the need for privacy and the benefits of big data analytics, regulators around the world are giving consumers control over their data, allowing them to choose whether or not to voluntarily share their purchase history data with firms. Intuition suggests that voluntary data sharing benefits consumers who can now choose to share their data only when it is profitable to do so. To investigate this argument, we built a model in which a monopolistic firm sells a repeatedly purchased product to consumers over two periods, and consumers decide whether or not to share their purchase history data with the firm, who can use it in the future to price-discriminate against them. We found that, compared to when data collection is completely outlawed, voluntary data sharing can benefit the firm but at the consumer’s expense. Moreover, regulations that mandate firms to better protect consumer data against data breaches can backfire on consumers. Finally, we show that under voluntary data sharing, a firm’s ability to offer consumers a monetary incentive to share their data can improve profits without hurting consumers. Taken together, these findings underscore the surprising effects of voluntary data sharing and caution public policymakers of how certain data policies that, on the surface, seem purely beneficial can lead to unintended consequences."

MISQ,2025,Human Capital Acquisition in Response to Data Breaches,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/19,"Given the rise in the frequency and cost of data security threats, it is critical to understand whether and how companies strategically adapt their operational workforce in response to data breaches. We study hiring in the aftermath of data breaches by combining information on data breach events with detailed firm-level job posting data. Using a staggered difference-in-differences approach, we show that breached firms significantly increase their demand for cybersecurity workers. Furthermore, firms’ responses to data breaches extend to promptly recruiting public relations personnel—an act aimed at managing trust and alleviating negative publicity—often ahead of cybersecurity hires. Following a breach, the likelihood of firms posting a cybersecurity job rises by approximately two percentage points, which translates to an average willingness to spend an additional $61,961 in annual wages on cybersecurity, public relations, and legal workers. While these hiring adjustments are small for affected firms, they represent a large potential impact of over $300 million on the overall economy. Our findings underscore the vital role of human capital investments in shaping firms’ cyber defenses and provide a valuable roadmap for managers and firms navigating cyberthreats in an increasingly digital age."
MISQ,2025,Do Crowds Validate False Data? Systematic Distortion and Affective Polarization,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/18,"This research note examines how sociocognitive influences can systematically distort crowdsourced ground truth in event-centric data through subgroups. The “wisdom of the crowd” is based on the assumption that consensus drives accuracy. While existing research addresses the tendencies of the overall crowd, this research note shows that identifiable subgroups within the crowd can systematically influence crowdsource validation. We conducted an immersive experiment to investigate whether crowd consensus can be systematically distorted by subgroup-based sociocognitive influences, such as affective polarization. In the experiment, raters from a range of subgroups with varying levels of affective polarization were asked to view and validate crisis data from a violent public riot in the year 2020. Relying in part on double debiased machine learning techniques, we analyzed heterogeneous treatment effects across subgroups. The results show that affective polarization and more extreme raters, via the constructs of loyalty and betrayal, distort consensus-based ground truth in different ways. This research note demonstrates how subgroup-based sociocognitive influences can systematically distort the results of consensus-based crowdsourced validation. Additionally, it provides guidance for research and practice on how to account for identifiable subgroups in the crowd. These findings challenge key assumptions about the wisdom of crowds and the accuracy of crowdsourced ground truth in event-centric situations."
MISQ,2025,Ruptures During IT-enabled Change: A Sensemaking and Imbrication Analysis,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/7,"Focusing on imbrication change as conducted by designers during design and development, we undertook a 2.5-year long case study to examine how 10 hospitals configured technology and planned routine changes as they sought to transform their organizations. Our observations revealed a phenomenon we call ruptures, defined as situations that occur due to breakdowns in the process of IT-enabled change. Ruptures allow us to unpack the temporal process of identifying and resolving instances of disruptive problems during IT-enabled change. Our analysis of ruptures in this context expands the theory of imbrication to account for the role of designers. We demonstrate that three imbrication types—historical, envisioned, and realized—exist cognitively during design and influence the design process. Our results demonstrate how problems arise, how dynamic change unfolds through sensemaking, and how fractal, embedded, imbrications complicate the IT-enabled change process."
MISQ,2025,The Critical Challenge of using Large-Scale Digital Experiment Platforms for Scientific Discovery,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/5,"Robust digital experimentation platforms have become increasingly pervasive at major technology and e-commerce firms worldwide. They allow product managers to use data-driven decision-making through online controlled experiments that estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) relative to a status quo control setting and make associated inferences. As demand for experiments continues to grow, orthogonal test planes (OTPs) have become the industry standard for managing the assignment of users to multiple concurrent experimental treatments in companies using large-scale digital experimentation platforms. In recent years, firms have begun to recognize that test planes might be confounding experimental results, but nevertheless, the practical benefits outweigh the costs. However, the uptick in practitioner-led digital experiments has coincided with an increase in academic-industry research partnerships, where large-scale digital experiments are being used to scientifically answer research questions, validate design choices, and/or derive computational social science-based empirical insights. In such contexts, confounding and biased estimation may have much more pronounced implications for the validity of scientific findings, contributions to theory, building a cumulative literature, and ultimately practice. The purpose of this Issues and Opinions article is to shed light on OTPs—in our experience, most researchers are unaware of how such test planes can lead to incorrect inferences. We used a case study conducted at a major e-commerce company to illustrate the extent to which interactions in concurrent experiments can bias ATEs, often making them appear more positive than they actually are. We discuss implications for research, including the distinction between practical industry experiments and academic research, methodological best practices for mitigating such concerns, and transparency and reproducibility considerations stemming from the complexity and opacity of large-scale experimentation platforms. More broadly, we worry that confounding in scientific research due to reliance on large-scale digital experiments meant to serve a different purpose is a microcosm of a larger epistemological confounding regarding what constitutes a contribution to scientific knowledge."
MISQ,2025,"Disentangling the Customer-Level, Cross-Channel Effects of Large-Order-Advantaged Online Shipping Policies",https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/15,"A key challenge in e-commerce retail is identifying a shipping fee policy that will incentivize more online orders and sales. To achieve this, retailers occasionally alter their shipping policies. While information systems research has extensively examined e-commerce channel strategies and their interplay with offline channels, it has yet to explore the online and offline implications of changes in e-commerce shipping policies. Against this backdrop, we studied a shipping policy change designed to incentivize higher-dollar orders, specifically, a large multichannel retailer’s shift from a tiered online shipping policy to a flat-rate policy. Using rich customer-level panel data and a regression discontinuity in time approach, we demonstrate that a flat-fee online shipping policy, counterintuitively, shifts sales away from the online channel and toward the offline channel—generating 23% more offline sales across 21,028 customers in five states. Evidence from additional analyses corroborated an account based on two mechanisms: an online order aggregation effect, wherein flat-fee shipping encouraged shipping fee-sensitive shoppers to aggregate purchases into larger orders, and an offline store interpurchase effect, wherein order aggregation generated longer interpurchase periods, during which customers met their needs for smaller purchases by visiting offline stores. Thus, a flat-rate shipping policy can serve as an unexpected lever for driving multichannel behavior. These findings contribute to the e-commerce channel interplay literature within information systems research and have important implications for legacy retailers seeking to leverage their brick-and-mortar investments to fend off competition from online-native retailers such as Amazon.com."
MISQ,2025,Popularity Feedback and Adaptation Strategies in Online Dating: A Social Comparison Perspective,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/9,"Digital platforms are increasingly employing informational nudges to motivate user participation. This paper examines the provision of popularity information as a feedback mechanism and its impact on users’ adaptation strategies. Leveraging ego utility theory and self-determination theory, we hypothesize that comparative popularity information—information that facilitates social comparison—will trigger different reactions based on gender and popularity level. In collaboration with an online dating service provider, we designed and conducted two randomized field experiments in which we provided popularity feedback to platform users and investigated their post-feedback behavioral changes in two adaptation strategies: the selectiveness in choosing potential partners (i.e., selectivity calibration) and the frequency of their online profile modifications (i.e., self-marketing). In the first experiment, where we revealed information about their popularity relative to other users, we found that those who received low-popularity feedback significantly increased self-marketing efforts and lowered their selectivity, but the opposite was observed in individuals who received high-popularity feedback. We also found that men readily made adaptations to their selectivity calibration and self-marketing, whereas women’s behaviors were more persistent as they exhibited little strategic change. We then conducted a second experiment in which we revealed absolute popularity instead of comparative popularity and observed no significant changes in adaptation strategies. Comparing the outcomes of the two experiments, we argue that it is the social comparison information associated with comparative popularity that drives user behavioral changes."
MISQ,2025,Defending Your Own or Trolling the Haters: A Configurational Approach to Incivility in Online Communities,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/11,"This study explores the emergence of incivility in online communities, challenging the traditional perspective that attributes incivility to individual elements of sociotechnical systems. We argue that this narrow focus fails to recognize the complex interactions between these elements, leading to a rudimentary understanding of how incivility originates and evolves. To address this gap, our research employed fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), examining approximately 4.3 million posts from 100 diverse online communities on Reddit. Through this analysis, we identified five distinct paths that converged into two primary community configurations: close-knit and scattered communities. Each configuration exhibits unique affordances whose activation fosters incivility in different ways. Based on these findings, we expand the understanding of incivility to include subtle, indirect behaviors beyond overt forms such as trolling or hate speech and show how the interplay of multiple community elements produces affordances, avoiding the narrow view of individual affordances and shedding light on variations of social systems. Finally, we demonstrate that within the same digital platform, different social systems can impact user behaviors, including incivility."
MISQ,2025,Privacy Concerns and Data Donations: Do Societal Benefits Matter?,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/6,"Data donations, where individuals are encouraged to donate their personal information, have the potential to advance medical research and help limit the spread of pandemics, among other benefits. The decision to donate data is fundamentally a privacy decision. In this research, we build on the privacy calculus, a model describing privacy risks and benefits, and examine the impact of privacy concerns on data donation decisions, highlighting the role of societal benefits in privacy decisions. Based on two randomized experiments using the general context of data donation for medical research (Experiment 1) and the specific context of data donation for COVID-19 research (Experiment 2), we find that individuals who are highly concerned about privacy tend to donate less data (Experiments 1 and 2). This effect holds under a variety of conditions and is consistent with prevailing research. However, this effect is contingent on the privacy calculus. When implicit or explicit societal benefits are perceived, particularly in the absence of privacy controls, the association between privacy concerns and data donation decisions is less salient, highlighting the significant role that societal benefits play in privacy decisions. We discuss the theoretical, practical, social, and ethical implications of these findings."

MISQ,2025,Social Norm Awareness and Norm Compliance in Online Games,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/10,"Online games are one of the most popular information systems in the world, with over 2 billion users worldwide. Most users follow the social norms and standards of behavior in online games, but some violate social norms, negatively affecting others’ gameplay experiences and weakening loyalty to the game. The social norms in games and other online environments often differ from the social norms in the real world, so are users who violate norms doing so deliberately or are they unaware of the norms? Our results suggest that many users violate social norms because they do not understand them—about a third of the 1,093 participants in our study reported being unsure of the social norms in an online game they played regularly. Greater experience with a game did not significantly increase social norm awareness. Instead, perceptions of social presence, and learning routines (i.e., community learning and instructional support) influenced social norm awareness, which in turn influenced norm compliance. Thus, a technology’s social affordances, social presence, and learning routines are more important than experience using a technology for helping users become aware of and comply with social norms."
MISQ,2025,How Artifact-Based and Authority-Based Coordination Affect Propagation Costs in Open Source Software Development,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/19,"The success of open source software (OSS) projects depends on their ability to produce software architectures with low propagation costs, as such architectures demand little effort from developers. This study focuses on the project’s form of coordination—the way in which interdependent contributions are managed—as a driving force behind propagation costs. It distinguishes between two coordination archetypes. First, artifact-based coordination is found in egalitarian projects, in which developers only use the work artifact (the architecture itself), without direct interaction, to coordinate. Second, authority-based coordination is used in hierarchical projects (e.g., Linux Kernel) or when companies pay developers for their work. Using a computational model, this study compares these two coordination mechanisms by simulating how they build software architectures (formalized as design structure matrices) from interdependent contributions. As a contextual condition, the model considers the degree of architecture visibility, which is the developers’ (in)ability to see recent additions to the architecture. The model provides two insights. First, artifact-based coordination, as compared to authority-based coordination, generally leads to lower propagation costs. Second, decreasing the degree of architecture visibility reduces propagation costs, an effect that I describe as focal-layered superposition. These insights contribute to the literatures on coordination in OSS development and the mirroring hypothesis. They also have practical implications for the creation of preferable architectures in OSS development."
MISQ,2025,The Hidden Cost of IT Innovation: Access to Emerging Technologies and the Gender Wage Gap,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/14,"Although an extensive information systems literature has explored the economic benefits of information technology (IT) investments, how these benefits are distributed between male and female IT workers has not been as closely examined. This paper bridges this gap by addressing two questions: (1) Do women and men have similar opportunities to acquire skills related to new IT innovations? (2) How do these differences affect the gender pay gap? We argue that women are underrepresented in roles that use emerging technologies due to two interrelated processes: demand-side labor market conditions and supply-side job sorting. By analyzing two independent datasets that provide insights into wages, career trajectories, and skill prerequisites for IT roles, we found that women are less likely to apply for jobs requiring expertise with emerging technologies. Such positions often require extended work hours, frequent job mobility, and geographic relocation—which can conflict with the family responsibilities typically assumed by women. Yet because these positions tend to offer higher wages, women’s underrepresentation in these roles exacerbates the gender pay gap in the IT sector. Our findings stress the importance of creating more flexible job structures and enhancing women’s access to emerging technology roles as critical for achieving gender equity in the IT industry."
MISQ,2025,Behavior Toward Newcomers and Contributions to Online Communities,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/16,"In this paper, we study whether and how behavior toward newcomers impacts their socialization outcomes in terms of retention and the quality of contributions in online communities. By exploiting a natural experiment on a large deal-sharing platform, we found that an intervention that proactively reminds other community members to be more considerate of newcomers caused newcomer deals to receive 54% more comments and increased the positive sentiment of the comments. The newcomers in the treatment group were 10% more likely than newcomers in the non-treatment group to post another deal, suggesting an increase in retention. However, we did not observe any effect of the intervention on the quality of subsequent contributions. Our evidence suggests that the intervention merely caused a temporary shock to newcomers’ first contributions but did not improve their learning or motivate greater effort in subsequent contributions. We draw implications on the design of socialization processes to help communities improve the retention and performance of newcomers."
MISQ,2025,Supporting Community First Responders in Aging in Place: An Action Design for a Community-Based Smart Activity Monitoring System,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/15,"To maintain elderly individuals’ ability to live independently in their own homes, technologies such as sensors and the internet of things can be used to facilitate real-time monitoring and automate emergency detection and alerts to enable first responders to deliver help on time. This study examines the design problems associated with such activity monitoring systems, particularly how to support the situational awareness of community first responders who are located remotely and do not have professional healthcare knowledge. Based on a three-year action design research study that investigated a sensor-based monitoring system for elderly people deployed in a natural community setting, we developed abstract design knowledge. Four design principles aimed at enhancing responders’ perceptions, comprehension, and projection of information are proposed to promote informed decision-making and timely responses by drawing on the situational awareness model. In addition to the nascent design knowledge regarding remote activity monitoring in different instances, this study extends our knowledge of the community-based model by foregrounding its multiplicity and the active roles of community stakeholders in providing care to elderly people."

MISQ,2025,Advancing Understanding of Scaling Health Information Infrastructures: Learning from EHR Initiatives in England,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/17,"Many countries are developing health information infrastructures (HII) such as integrated electronic health records (EHRs) as a means of improving healthcare efficiency and effectiveness. However, efforts to build and scale up HII are fraught with challenges, as exemplified by the well-known case of the National Health Service (NHS) in England. In particular, HII scaling initiatives give rise to tensions, such as across geographical boundaries of EHRs, which are often not effectively addressed in practice. At the same time, there have been calls for research on scaling IS through a practice perspective, which adds to the existing categorical analysis of scale. Thus motivated, we aim to conceptualize the scaling of HII, focusing on the tensions between scales, the practices to accomplish scaling, and their consequences for scaling outcomes. To do so, we undertook a case study of recent NHS efforts to integrate EHRs in England, where we analyzed these scalar concepts and their interrelationships. Our study further develops the notion that scaling not only involves increasing the scale of IS but entails constructing and reconstructing scales. We also offer theoretical contributions by conceptualizing the range of scalar tensions and practices, their interplay, and their influences on HII scaling outcomes. Tensions that we identify as associated with different scale boundaries (organizational, spatial, and technological), extend those recognized in prior research. Furthermore, we uncover the scalar practices of joining and differentiating, adding to the governance and architectural approaches for HII scaling examined in past work. Through deepening the understanding of HII scaling, we generate insights for practitioners by highlighting scalar tensions and practices that could address the tensions under different conditions. Overall, we draw attention to scaling phenomena as being integral to the development of HII and introduce a new vocabulary for thinking about HII scaling."
MISQ,2025,Breached and Denied: The Cost of Data Breaches on Individuals as Mortgage Application Denials,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/7,"While a large body of information systems (IS) literature has investigated the antecedents and consequences of data breaches in organizations, we do not have a good understanding of whether a data breach has a material impact on individuals whose private information is compromised and how much damage it causes. We overcome empirical challenges in investigating the impact of data breaches on individual victims by utilizing a unique natural experimental setting that allows us to credibly identify treated and controlled populations—the breach of South Carolina (SC) taxpayer records in 2012. With residents in SC as the treatment group and those in Georgia and North Carolina as the control group, our difference-in-differences estimations find that after the breach at the SC Department of Revenue, there was a significant increase in denials to SC residents’ residential mortgage applications for refinance and home improvement. We also find that the adverse impact of the breach was more profound for Black and Hispanic residents. Our study provides significant theoretical and policy implications with respect to the harm and costs of a large-scale data breach."
MISQ,2025,"Causal Inference Grounded in Causal Diagrams: Benefits, Limitations, and Opportunities for the Information Systems Field",https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/5,"We join the important effort of embracing diverse views on causality reflected in a prior MIS Quarterly Editor’s Comment (Mithas et al., 2022b). Specifically, we aim to expand the discussion around a major causal framework and toolkit that, we believe, is largely missing and needed in empirical studies in the field of information systems: that of causal diagrams and structural causal modeling (SCM). Being relatively new, the SCM framework has faced resistance from economists that has only recently begun to soften and, for this reason, remains largely absent in econometrics textbooks and in the curriculum of most information systems PhD programs. In contrast to viewpoints emphasizing the dichotomy between SCM and econometrics or potential outcomes approaches, we explain how SCM can serve as a complementary layer of identification and communication that aligns with such proven design and analysis frameworks. We discuss the current limitations of the SCM framework and opportunities for new research."
MISQ,2025,Understanding the Effectiveness of Rewarding Recipients on Online Referral Behavior,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/8,"Online referral programs predominantly focus on incentivizing referrers to make referrals but largely ignore the potential of rewarding recipients to motivate referral behaviors. In this paper, we systematically examine whether, how, and when rewarding recipients could effectively motivate referrers with five experiments across a variety of settings. The results demonstrate that rewarding recipients is effective in motivating referrers to behave prosocially and make referrals. Interestingly, referrers behave prosocially when they are not rewarded, but the effectiveness of rewarding recipients is reduced if referrers are rewarded. We also reveal that referrers’ prosocial behaviors are primarily driven by altruistic motivation, rather than the pursuit of either reputational or collective benefits; notably, offering rewards to referrers dampens their altruistic motivation. Finally, we find that referrers’ prosocial behaviors are inhibited with an increased action cost of their referral behaviors, while their prosocial behaviors persist, even with an increased interpersonal cost associated with the referral behaviors. We conclude by offering theoretical and managerial implications for designing effective referral strategies that leverage the potential of rewarding recipients."
MISQ,2025,How Collaboration Technology Use Affects IT Project Team Creativity: Integrating Team Knowledge and Creative Synthesis Perspectives,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/12,"Contemporary IT project teams engage in creative problem solving to address increasingly complex business problems, highlighting the need to promote IT project team creativity. Collaboration technologies are widely used in IT project teams, but little is known about what collaboration technology features can be used to improve IT project team creativity and what the underlying influencing mechanisms are. To address this important gap, the current study builds on the extended team knowledge framework to identify collaboration technology features and decodes their influencing mechanisms on IT project team creativity by drawing on the novel creative synthesis theory originating in the management literature to the IT project team context. We identify three sets of collaboration technology support features—awareness knowledge supports, long-term knowledge supports, and transitional knowledge supports—and posit that their use can improve IT project team creativity by facilitating the creative synthesis process, which includes the three subconstructs of collective attention, similarity building, and enacting ideas. The research model is supported in general by empirical data collected through a multisourced survey of over 500 team members and their leaders from 62 IT project teams. We conclude with a discussion of theoretical and practical implications."

MISQ,2025,Design Principles for Information Categorization Quality in Crowdsourced Crisis Mapping Platforms,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/18,"Crisis mapping platforms have transformed disaster management and digital humanitarian efforts by allowing victims to quickly submit “Requests for Help” (RFH) messages directly from disaster locations via mobile devices. On these platforms, online volunteers are often engaged in processing and categorizing messy and incomplete RFH messages into structured and useful crisis reports that can aid first responders in their recovery efforts. This research note examines the case of the Ushahidi platform deployed during the 2010 Haiti Earthquake to propose design principles for a crisis mapping platform that facilitates the conversion and categorization of victim-submitted RFH messages into actionable crisis reports for on-site first responders. To validate the proposed design principles, we instantiated them with the help of a template, and conducted a series of experiments to confirm the effectiveness of the template in improving the categorization quality of crisis reports. We expect that the design principles will be particularly useful for developing digital platforms aimed at humanitarian crisis response that requires a large-scale participation of online crowd volunteers."

MISQ,2025,Emergence of IT Implementation Consequences in Organizations: An Assemblage Approach,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/13,"Ex nihilo nihil fit—nothing comes from nothing—fundamentally challenges IS scholars to explain how a new behavior may emerge and evolve into a recognizable practice from an organization’s IT implementation processes. Prior research addressing this problem has ascribed consequences to a preexisting macrolevel structure or microlevel interactions. We examined this issue by conceptualizing the emergence of IT implementation consequences as a multiphased process with analytically disaggregated phases. Using an assemblage lens, our theorizing draws on data from a multisite case study of body-worn camera technology implementation in three municipal police organizations in the U.S. We identified three emergence phases—individuation, composition, and actualization—and developed a process model theorizing a path from material and expressive components to IT implementation consequences through cascading properties and capacities. Our model shows that the emergence of IT implementation consequences is nonlinear and involves feedback loops across multiple phases. In some instances, IT implementation consequences may emerge via negative feedback loops involving tweaks and course correction before converging into recognizable new practices. In other instances, they may fail or convergence into recognizable practices may be delayed. We also show how combining existing components and assemblages results in nesting assemblages at successively larger scales. This allowed us to relativize the micro-macro relationship and explain both top-down and bottom-up emergence of IT implementation consequences."
MISQ,2025,An Empirical Study of Strategic Opacity in Crowdsourced Evaluations,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/18,"Crowd-voting mechanisms are commonly used to implement scalable evaluations of crowdsourced creative submissions. Unfortunately, the use of crowd-voting also raises the potential for gaming and manipulation. Manipulation is problematic because (1) submitters’ motivation depends on their belief that the system is meritocratic, and (2) manipulated feedback may undermine learning, as submitters seek to learn from received evaluations and those of peers. In this work, we consider a design approach to addressing the issue, focusing on the notion of strategic opacity, i.e., purposefully obfuscating evaluation procedures. On the one hand, opacity may reduce the incentive and thus the prevalence of vote manipulation, and submitters may instead dedicate that time and effort to improving their submission quantity or quality. On the other hand, because opacity makes it difficult for submitters to discern the returns to legitimate effort, submitters may also reduce their submission effort or simply exit the market. We explored this tension via a multimethod study employing field experiments at 99designs and a controlled experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We observed consistent results across all experiments: opacity leads to reductions in gaming in these crowdsourcing contests and significant increases in the allocation of effort toward legitimate vs. illegitimate activities, with no discernible influence on contest participation. We discuss boundary conditions and the implications for contest organizers and contest platform operators."
MISQ,2025,Mobile Advertising in Distracted Environments: Exploring the Impact of Distractions on Dual-Task Interference,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/11,"It is increasingly common for consumers to engage with various tasks on their personal devices amid other distractions such as watching television at home, shopping at malls, or attending concerts. While this split in attention poses challenges, it also opens valuable opportunities for advertisers to strategically push targeted advertisements based on information about the user’s environment. Across a series of controlled lab experiments using a custom app developed for this study, we demonstrate how marketers can optimize pop-up advertising on consumers’ personal devices within distraction-filled environments. In doing so, we extend traditional insights from dual-task interference studies that have previously focused on corresponding tasks in isolation, without considering any stimuli from the environment. Our results indicate that, in the presence of additional stimuli from the environment, a facilitating relationship exists between the attention paid to a task and the effectiveness of pop-up advertisements interrupting the task. However, this relationship is moderated by the extent of attention diffusion from the environment. As the distance between the task and the environment increases, consumer attention to the task is more diffused, resulting in poorer encoding of the pop-up advertisements. Critically, optimizing the content and timing of pop-up advertisements to the environmental content can significantly improve their effectiveness. Our results have important implications for helping marketers develop actionable strategies for mobile advertising in distraction-filled environments."
MISQ,2025,Do Digital Platforms Improve the Performance of Nonbinding Contracts? Evidence from the Amazon Freight Platform,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/7,"This research examines how digital platforms influence the performance of nonbinding contracts. Businesses in many industries with high uncertainty, such as trucking freight and construction, simultaneously use nonbinding contracts, which impose no legal sanctions for refusals, and spot markets, which facilitate real-time, flexible transactions with market-determined prices. Understanding the conditions under which nonbinding contracts perform is a major concern in these industries. Leveraging the entry of the Amazon Freight platform in the trucking freight industry, we demonstrate that adding a digital platform-enabled spot marketplace improves the performance of nonbinding contracts. We identified several mechanisms driving this effect: (1) expanding carriers’ transportation capacity, (2) lowering spot market prices, and (3) reducing shippers’ reliance on nonbinding contracts for shorter-haul truckloads. Moreover, the digital platform’s impact on enhancing nonbinding contract performance is particularly pronounced in markets with volatile demand and shorter hauls. This research contributes to understanding the impacts of digital platforms in highly uncertain industries that simultaneously use nonbinding contracts and spot markets. Our findings provide implications to policymakers and business managers on leveraging digital platforms to improve operational efficiency in highly uncertain industries."
MISQ,2025,Dancing to the #Challenge: The Effect of TikTok on Closing the Artist Gender Gap in the Music Industry,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/6,"This study investigates how “Hashtag Dance Challenges” (HDCs), a phenomenon popularized on the short-video platform TikTok, are instrumental in helping music artists gain traction in the digital music marketplace. HDCs represent an appealing combination of music and dance, designed to engage users and achieve virality, thereby benefiting artists whose music is featured. This research focuses on how HDCs contribute to the success of women artists, as compared to men, in an industry known for its diversity but challenged by gender inclusivity. We apply role congruity theory to posit that women artists are in a better position to derive benefits from being featured on HDCs, relative to male artists, particularly in cases of gender concordance—when both the creator and the artist are women. We measure the benefits of HDCs using daily changes in the artist’s followership on Spotify, a leading music streaming service, and test our hypotheses using song and artist-level data collected from Spotify and TikTok. We found that artists featured in a new HDC achieve a significant increase in followership on Spotify, relative to similar artists not featured in an HDC. Further, we observed that women creators drive this effect, enhancing the daily growth of Spotify followers by approximately 3% more for women artists, underscoring the value of gender concordance. Our findings shed light on the role of short videos, especially through the vehicle of HDCs, in advancing women artists, while also promoting inclusivity within the digital music industry."
MISQ,2025,Organizing for AI Innovation: Insights from an Empirical Exploration of U.S. Patents,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/13,"Although the prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI) innovations is on the rise, firms frequently report failures and setbacks in their development and implementation of AI innovation efforts. One common issue behind many failing AI initiatives is that they are organized just like other information technology (IT) innovation efforts. To elucidate why and how the production of AI and IT innovations may need to be managed differently, this study juxtaposes these two types of innovations based on two key dimensions of the Schumpeterian framework: the form (product vs. process) and magnitude (radical vs. incremental) of innovations. By analyzing a matched sample of AI and IT patents, we found robust evidence that AI innovations are less radical and more process oriented than comparable IT innovations. Drawing upon our empirical discovery, we developed a conceptual framework to suggest a new way to think about organizing AI innovation. Our research contributes to the literature and practice on AI innovation by illuminating the comparative differences between AI innovations and other IT innovations and advancing a set of empirically derived propositions on how firms may be able to better manage their AI innovation activities."
MISQ,2025,Does Ransomware Make Investors “WannaCry”? On Investors’ Divergent Reactions to Ransomware Hits and Near Misses,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/15,"In recent years, ransomware has become one of the most dangerous cyber threats, with successful attacks causing severe operational disruptions and staggering damages. Rationally speaking, investors should react negatively to firms’ ransomware disclosures, but this may not always be the case. Based on norm theory, we describe a paradoxical phenomenon wherein investors exhibit negative reactions to ransomware hits (i.e., events that led to operational disruptions) but positive reactions to near misses (i.e., events in which operational disruptions were narrowly avoided). The positive reactions occur due to an outcome bias in which near-miss events—events that are objectively negative but less severe than expected—are viewed positively instead of negatively. We tested these predictions by reporting on an investigation of stock market reactions to disclosures of ransomware hits vs. near misses. To do so, we assembled a comprehensive dataset of ransomware incidents disclosed by U.S. public firms. Using the event study method, we estimated abnormal stock market returns and found evidence in support of our predictions. First, in line with expectations, ransomware hits that led to the expected severe impact resulted in stock price drops of -4.40%. However, near misses, where disruptions were avoided, were rewarded with gains of 2.87%, confirming positive instead of negative reactions. This offers new insights into investors’ biased responses to certain cybersecurity incidents. These positive reactions, however, represent a call for caution because, albeit seemingly favorable, they mask underlying risks."
MISQ,2025,Engaging Physicians with Introductory Incentives: References to Online and Offline Income,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/8,"Incentives make or break user contributions. While providing introductory incentives to attract new users has become increasingly popular among online communities, their impact on user contributions remains largely unknown. Utilizing a policy change that doubled the incentives paid to physicians in a leading online health community, we examined the impacts of both the initiation and the termination of such introductory incentives on physician contributions (in terms of patient consultations) and how the impacts varied according to the physician’s online and offline income. We found that despite an increase in physician contributions during the policy window, the introductory incentives unintentionally decreased physician contributions after the policy window ended. Additionally, physicians tended to anchor their contributions using their online rather than offline income as a reference point, suggesting that mental accounting was at play. Our findings provide a cautionary perspective on the unintended consequences of using introductory incentives and reveal the associated mechanisms of mental accounting when users make contributions (or not) to online communities. These findings provide important implications for incentive design and user engagement in online communities."
MISQ,2025,Find the Good. Seek the Unity: A Hidden Markov Model of Human-AI Delegation Dynamics,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/17,"As AI becomes integral to enterprise decision-making, this study explores the collaborative dynamics between managers and AI systems, focusing on human willingness to delegate tasks to AI. Grounded in the “agentic” systems delegation framework and instance-based learning theory, we employed a hidden Markov model in a longitudinal study of the dynamic delegation decision-making process involving 875 store managers. We found that there is a potential polarization in managers’ delegation willingness, with managers who recognize the capability of AI exhibiting high delegation willingness and fostering increased collaboration with AI over time—in contrast to their counterparts who are inclined to reduce AI’s involvement. During human-AI interactions, managers’ continuous performance appraisal of AI shapes their dynamic delegation willingness, which in turn affects their assessment of AI capability. This process forms a delegation feedback loop that drives the dynamics of delegation behaviors. Our study indicates that managers with a high willingness to delegate tend to outperform their counterparts and offers valuable insights for human-AI collaborative intelligence in organizational settings."

MISQ,2025,The Interplay Between Healthcare Information Technologies and Denied Claims,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/16,"This study investigates the role of health information technology (HIT) in reducing claim denials, which are a significant burden for healthcare providers in the U.S. We theorize the impacts of electronic health records (EHRs) on claim denials, starting with an examination of EHR adoption and followed by a deeper assessment of how EHRs are sourced both within a hospital and across hospitals in the same health system. We propose that while EHR adoption reduces the likelihood of claim denials by improving the accuracy and completeness of information processing, it can also increase claim denials if EHR applications are sourced from multiple vendors within a hospital or different vendors across hospitals. Using a large-scale dataset of claim records from the state of Maryland from 2012-2016, we found that the greater the EHR adoption by care providers, the less likely a claim is denied. In addition, our findings suggest that EHRs are more effective in preventing denials when a hospital sources EHR applications from a single vendor and when a group of hospitals in the same health system sources EHRs from the same vendor. Additionally, we observed a decrease in claim denials when physicians previously worked in hospitals utilizing EHR applications from the same vendor. This study provides significant theoretical insights into the information systems literature on HIT and offers practical implications for healthcare providers by uncovering the multifaceted roles of EHRs in information processing and compliance."

MISQ,2025,"Automating in High-Expertise, Low-Label Environments: Evidence-Based Medicine by Expert-Augmented Few-Shot Learning",https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/12,"Many real-world process automation environments are rife with high-expertise and limited labeled data. We propose a computational design science artifact to automate systematic review (SR) in such an environment. SR is a manual process that collects and synthesizes data from medical literature to inform medical decisions and improve clinical practice. Existing machine learning solutions for SR automation suffer from a lack of labeled data and a misrepresentation of the high-expertise manual process. Motivated by humans’ impressive capability to learn from limited examples, we propose a principled and generalizable few-shot learning framework—FastSR—to automate the multistep, expertise-intensive SR process using minimal training data. Informed by SR experts’ annotation logic, FastSR extends the traditional few-shot learning framework by including (1) various representations to account for diverse SR knowledge, (2) attention mechanisms to reflect semantic correspondence of medical text fragments, and (3) shared representations to jointly learn interrelated tasks (i.e., sentence classification and sequence tagging). We instantiated and evaluated FastSR on three test beds: full-text articles from Wilson disease (WD) and COVID-19, as well as a public dataset (EBM-NLP) containing clinical trial abstracts on a wide range of diseases. Our experiments demonstrate that FastSR significantly outperforms several benchmarking solutions and expedites the SR project by up to 65%. We critically examine the SR outcomes and practical advantages of FastSR compared to other ML and manual SR solutions and propose a new FastSR-augmented protocol. Overall, our multifaceted evaluation quantitatively and qualitatively underscores the efficacy and applicability of FastSR in expediting SR. Our results have important implications for designing computational artifacts for automating/augmenting processes in high-expertise, low-label environments."

MISQ,2025,The Complementor’s Dilemma: Navigating Growth Ambitions and the Dependency on Focal Actors in Platform Ecosystems,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/14,"The literature on platform ecosystems increasingly recognizes that nonfocal actors such as complementors may have growth ambitions. Such ambitions, if successfully advanced, may even elevate the complementor’s position in the platform ecosystem to that of a focal actor. However, transitioning from nonfocal actor to focal actor is challenging. Along the way, the nonfocal actor may need to choose between the seemingly unfavorable alternatives of acting on its growth ambitions—risking losing the focal actors’ support needed for that growth—or relinquishing its ambitions to ensure the support of the focal actors continues. Referring to this phenomenon as the complementor’s dilemma, we unpack the process whereby a nonfocal actor can pursue growth ambitions while successfully managing relationships with the focal platforms in the ecosystem. To address this research problem, we conducted an in-depth, embedded case study of a Chinese short-form video platform, Douyin (known as TikTok outside of China), from its inception as a complement in 2016 to its establishment as a focal actor in 2018. During this two-year period, Douyin grew spectacularly from 0.75 million to 208.28 million users. We examined the process through which Douyin navigated the complementor’s dilemma multiple times within the confines of its dependency on Weibo and WeChat, the focal actors in China’s social network platform ecosystem. We contribute to the platform ecosystem literature by offering a process perspective that conceptualizes the complementor’s dilemma and theorizes how to navigate the dilemma when transitioning from a nonfocal actor to a focal actor in a platform ecosystem."
MISQ,2025,Augmented Reality at Work: Attention Management and Its Impact on Work Performance,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/10,"Augmented reality (AR) is rapidly emerging as a transformative display technology, blending computer-generated content with the real-world environment in real time. Using divided attention theory, this study investigates how different information delivery channels (i.e., AR vs. mobile phone) and the nature of information (i.e., dependence on specific physical context and complexity) affect work performance. A field experiment in the aircraft maintenance context demonstrates that the effect on work performance of providing information via AR vs. a mobile phone is mediated by work attentiveness. The findings reveal that the effectiveness of AR is particularly pronounced when information is highly dependent on the specific physical context but diminishes when information complexity is high. This research deepens our understanding of how presenting information directly in front of users’ eyes (i.e., via AR) affects their attention management and work performance. The findings have significant implications for firms in terms of how to leverage AR to enhance work performance in industrial settings."
MISQ,2025,Fake News and True News Assessment: The Persuasive Effect of Discursive Evidence in Judging Veracity,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/5,"Individuals are often unable to assess the veracity of news claims—especially on social media platforms. Recent research has suggested that interventions indicating normative signals, such as flagging false claims, are not always effective. We propose an approach in which users are provided with discursive evidence to consider in determining the veracity of claims rather than depending on normative true or false flags. We conducted a series of experiments to explore the effects of different forms of discursive evidence on individual judgments of the veracity of news claims. We found that providing such evidence can significantly improve individuals’ judgment of both true and false news claims—with certain caveats. Providing discursive evidence with high evidence strength leads to a general increase in veracity judgment. Discursive evidence containing items with lower evidence strength may shift believability—thus improving judgments for either true or false claims but degrading them for the other. We also identify important asymmetries between true and false claims, finding that the effect of some evidence may be improved if people are in a more critical mindset—for example, by priming them to think about the concept of truth and lies. Taken together, these results extend knowledge on the problem of fake news and may suggest effective approaches to address the problem without diminishing attention to true news."

MISQ,2025,Producing the “We” in High-Risk Online Activism: Identity Configurations in My Stealthy Freedom,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/9,"The research on online social movements generally concludes that collective identity, i.e., the sense of we-ness that individual protesters in a movement share, is not only unattainable but also dispensable, even though it is considered a defining feature of traditional movements. In this paper, we explore one of the boundary conditions of these findings, namely the riskiness of protest practices. Analysing the high-risk social movement, My Stealthy Freedom (MySF), which contests compulsory hijab in Iran in a way that hybridizes online and offline protest practices, we show that a sense of collectiveness can be instantiated in online social movements, why it is critical to the success of high-risk activism, and how it is (re)produced. Comparing and contrasting three instantiations of MySF, each of which was enacted on a different social media platform, we develop a theoretical model of how feelings of collectiveness are enacted in high-risk online activism. In addition to providing guidance for online movements where collective identity is desirable, our study challenges prior research on online activism by theorizing the role of embodiment, affect, and the dialectic between activists’ personal and the movement’s collective identity."
MISQ,2025,"Information Technology Firms and Revenue Stall, 1950-2015: Theory and Empirical Evidence",https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/19,"A slowdown in revenue growth, referred to as revenue stall in this study, is a key concern for any firm. We examine how information technology-producing firms (i.e., IT firms) differ from non-IT firms in experiencing revenue stall and in benefiting from R&D investments in terms of reduced revenue stall. We hypothesize that whereas IT firms experience more revenue stall than non-IT firms, R&D investments reduce revenue stall to a greater extent in IT firms than in non-IT firms. Our empirical analyses of a longitudinal dataset of more than 1,400 large public firms in the United States from 1950 to 2015 broadly support our hypotheses. Consistent with the theoretical arguments underlying our hypotheses, we also find that IT firms experience higher competition, dynamism, and turbulence, and have higher intangible assets than non-IT firms."

MMIS,2025,Hate Speech Detection on Online News Platforms: A Deep-Learning Approach Based on Agenda-Setting Theory,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2520173,"Hate speech on online news platforms has emerged as a critical societal challenge, influencing public discourse and impacting industries. However, existing detection methods often fail to capture its contextual nature and are grounded in weak theoretical foundations. To address this gap, we integrate agenda-setting theory with design science paradigms to develop a deep learning model for detecting hate speech on online news platforms. Leveraging bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), our model analyzes the interplay between news headlines, texts, and user comments, capturing both media issue salience and emotional agenda-setting effects. Empirical validation demonstrates that our model outperforms traditional baselines in hate speech detection and topic classification tasks. This contextualized approach enhances prediction accuracy, explainability, and domain adaptability, contributing to improved performance and broader applicability. Our study makes theoretical and methodological contributions to Information Systems research and offers practical insights for implementing ethical, real-time hate speech detection strategies."
MMIS,2025,Can Correction Messages Reduce the Spread of Fake News on Social Media? The Impact of Information Updates on the Effectiveness of Corrections,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2520174,"Although government agencies and fact-checking organizations issue correction messages to mitigate misinformation dissemination on social media, their efforts have been largely ineffective. Drawing on Information Manipulation Theory (IMT) and information extracted from over 84 million tweets, we examine the impact of correction messages and explore how different information updates affect their effectiveness. Our empirical approach differentiates between subpopulations of correction messages. The results support the existence of two distinct types: correction messages that significantly mitigate the spread of fake news—a 1 percent increase in “effective” messages decreases the spread of fake news by 0.89 percent; and those that amplify the misinformation—a 1 percent increase in “ineffective” messages increases the spread of fake news by 1.37 percent. Despite the higher count of “effective” correction messages, they are less potent than their “ineffective” counterparts. Our study extends the tenets of IMT to correction messages to identify effective platform interventions and highlight the efficacy of information updates in reducing the spread of fake news. Furthermore, it offers significant insights to social media platforms and fact-checking organizations on designing and deploying effective corrections."

This study, grounded in the sociotechnical and social learning perspectives, examines the drivers and outcomes of social learning in ideologically charged firestorms, which represent an emerging form. We investigate the effects of social consensus and message persuasiveness, platform content centricity, and individual–firm relationship closeness on the social learning of negative eWOM behavior and purchase behavior. Two studies, comprising longitudinal quantitative and qualitative surveys, were conducted. The results indicate that message persuasiveness is strongly associated with the social learning of negative eWOM behavior. Negative eWOM behavior subsequently influences post-firestorm purchasing behavior. The moderating effects of platform content centricity and individual–firm relationship closeness are discussed. These findings advance the literature and offer practitioners actionable insights into managing digital crises."

We introduce the novel mechanism ofboundary morphing—apps expanding their boundaries by adding proprietary code or contracting them by increasing platform-sourced functionality—by integrating transaction cost economics (TCE) with platforms theory. Using seven years of data from over 600 AndroidOS apps, we show that platform specificity and market uncertainty drive boundary contraction, while frequent updates counterintuitively catalyze boundary expansion. App modularity—acting as a shift parameter—reshapes this calculus, enabling boundary expansion amid uncertainty and rapid updates. We contribute: (1) boundary morphing as a mechanism to straddle synergy-differentiation tradeoffs, (2) IS-native insights in a TCE scaffold to explain morphing, and (3) modularity’s role in reshaping it. Together, these findings explain how apps morph boundaries as an architectural lever to stay competitive."
MMIS,2025,Algorithmic Stakeholder Governance on Content Platforms: A Lead Role Perspective,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2520177,"Algorithmic governance is not enough on its own to manage and protect the interests of multiple stakeholders. Therefore, platforms are increasingly seeking to involve stakeholders in their algorithmic governance, synthesizing the domains of algorithmic governance and stakeholder governance. We denote this synthesis asalgorithmic stakeholder governance. In this paper, we examine algorithmic stakeholder governance in the context of content platforms focusing on the algorithmically mediated interactions among three key stakeholders—creators, consumers, and advertisers. We explore this topic by conducting an in-depth study of the YouTube platform. Using grounded theory techniques, we generate a model that explains the process by which platform stakeholder interactions are algorithmically governed to address key stakeholder conflicts related to free speech, information diversity, and content safety. Our model suggests that algorithmic stakeholder governance provides a forum for resolving these stakeholder conflicts and theorizes the interplay between the platform’s approach to algorithmic stakeholder governance and stakeholder participation. Our research contributes primarily to the literature on platform governance and algorithmic governance on platforms more specifically, by shifting the focus from centralized control and viewing users as objects of governance towards a more decentralized and balanced perspective where platform users are viewed as active stakeholders."
MMIS,2025,Roles of Psychological Recovery Experiences and Visual Anonymity in Team-based Gamified Online Learning,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2520175,"Gamification has been widely adopted by businesses and educational institutions to drive desired user behaviors and performance. Despite its significance across industry, healthcare, and organizational contexts, its role in fostering psychological recovery experiences (PRE) remains underexplored. Grounded in gamification frameworks and literature on affordances and PRE, this study investigates the mediating role of PRE between gamification affordances and personal initiative. Additionally, we examine the moderating effect of perceived visual anonymity as a situational affordance in the relationship between gamification affordances and PRE. To test our hypotheses, we collected data from 682 graduate students enrolled in an enterprise resource planning (ERP) course (Study 1: 258; Study 2: 424). Our findings reveal that mastery and control experiences mediate the relationship between collaboration and feedback affordances and personal initiative. Furthermore, perceived visual anonymity negatively moderates the relationship between collaboration affordance and mastery and control experiences, while positively moderating the relationship between feedback affordance and control experience. This study highlights the importance of psychological recovery experiences and perceived visual anonymity in fostering personal initiative within gamified online learning environments."
MMIS,2025,Risk of Cyberattacks Arising from Strategic Alliances with Big Tech,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2520176,"This research theorizes and documents for the first time a cyber risk that may arise from strategic alliances with Big Tech, a grouping of the most dominant companies in the information technology industry. This research proposes that alliances with Big Tech tend to involve leveraging and integrating Big Tech’s innovative technological capabilities into a focal firm’s data management, operations, products, or services. This process can be understood as an inter-organizational system of systems integration and is presented as a mechanism that makes focal firms vulnerable to external cyberattacks. In addition, this research theorizes and shows that the effect of strategic alliances with Big Tech on the risk of cyberattacks is not linear; instead, it increases up to a certain point and then starts decreasing. Finally, this research suggests that intangible asset intensity strengthens the relationship between strategic alliances with Big Tech and the risk of cyberattacks. The findings of this research provide timely and important insights into cyber risks arising from strategic alliances centered on integrating systems and technologies across partner firms’ boundaries."

Using an eye-tracking experiment, it examines participants’ responses to conflicting ratings, with a focus on attention patterns and decision-making. Results reveal that signal discrepancies significantly reduce trust. Participants exhibit increased cognitive load when confronted with inconsistent signals, as evidenced by longer fixation times and more frequent transitions between ratings. These findings suggest that conflicting information demands greater cognitive effort. The study also highlights the differential effects of primary (native) and secondary (imported) signals, demonstrating that platform-specific reputational systems play a dominant role in trust-building. By offering insights into the relationship among conflicting signals, trust, and cognitive processing, the study provides a novel theoretical perspective on reputation portability and derives practical implications for complementors and platform operators."
MMIS,2025,Digital Skill Visibility and Job Promotion of Open Source Software Developers,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2520171,"Material to inform the decisions on the job promotion of open source software (OSS) developers is available on platforms. Digital features increase the visibility of OSS developer technical and interpersonal skills. Digital features also make it possible for OSS developers to visibly receive endorsements and recommendations from others about those skills. It is unclear how well the visibility of technical versus interpersonal skills through such digital features facilitates OSS developer job promotions. Leveraging Turner’s contest-sponsored mobility framework [66], we theorize and empirically examine these concerns using a sample of 269 OSS developers. We find that a developer making their technical skills visible on digital platforms is associated with job promotions. In contrast, the visibility of interpersonal skills through recommendations affects job promotions. Our findings contribute to theory and practice by providing a lens to understand the differential effects of technical versus interpersonal skill visibility offered by different digital features and their effect on OSS developer job promotions."
MMIS,2025,Impact of Non-Diagnostic Digital Services on Online Healthcare Consultation,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2520180,"The persistent preference of patients for well-known healthcare providers inevitably leads to demand imbalances within the healthcare sector. Luckily, our research reveals that online healthcare platforms (OHPs) can address this issue by offering non-diagnostic digital services. Using an OHP-based online prescribing service as an example, our study reveals that this non-diagnostic digital service has resulted in a significant increase in consultations, particularly for less prominent hospitals and junior physicians. This shift promotes a more equitable distribution of healthcare demand. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the balancing effect primarily arises from attracting low-uncertainty demand–consultations that focus less on diagnosis—and from fostering trust between patients and physicians. Our findings present a compelling information systems (IS) solution to the pressing issue of patient demand imbalance. By illustrating how a non-diagnostic digital solution can transform healthcare delivery and enhance resource allocation, we contribute to improved healthcare efficiency. This paper offers insights for researchers focused on OHP design and for health practitioners seeking to leverage digital solutions to manage demand."

MMIS,2025,Generative AI and its Transformative Value for Digital Platforms,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2487315,"The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) represents a watershed moment in the evolution of digital platforms. The capabilities of this AI technology go beyond traditional AI systems, enabling the autonomous generation of novel outcomes with significant implications for platform value creation, architecture, governance, and stakeholder interactions. We develop an integrative conceptual framework that identifies four key mechanisms through which GenAI transforms digital platforms: intelligent automation, democratization, hyper-personalization, and collaborative innovation. Through intelligent automation, GenAI transforms boundary resources from passive interfaces into active, intelligent mediators of value creation. Democratization systematically lowers barriers to platform participation. Hyper-personalization enables dynamic, individual-level adaptation of platform content. Collaborative innovation transforms platform innovation by making GenAI an active participant in human-AI value co-creation. We use this framework to situate the papers in the special issue and develop a research agenda that explores the transformative impact of GenAI on platform stakeholder relationships."

Although prior work found an overall decrease in knowledge seeking in online communities upon the availability of GenAI, the underlying dynamics across user groups have remained unexplored. This study addresses that gap. Drawing on commitment-based theory, we hypothesize that casual users—motivated by cost-benefit considerations—are more likely to reduce their question-posting activity than highly committed members. Using adifference-in-differencesanalysis, we find that ChatGPT’s arrival leads to a substantial drop in questions on StackExchange, primarily driven by casual users (about 18.2%). Motivated by information foraging theory, we reveal heterogeneous downstream effects of GenAI on question characteristics. In particular, we find that the questions by casual users become more complex and novel, while those by intensive and top users do not. These results highlight the importance of heterogeneous user motivations in shaping platform dynamics, underscoring that while GenAI may diminish overall participation, it may also increase the value of the remaining content. Our study offers insights for knowledge sharing communities, managers, and stakeholders reliant on user-generated data, providing a nuanced view of GenAI’s disruptive influence."

As GenAI tools hold unique characteristics compared to traditional boundary resources, platform owners need to adapt their governance mechanisms accordingly. To understand how platform governance evolves over time in response to this novel boundary resource, we draw on the distributed tuning framework and build on insights from an in-depth qualitative study of a digital content platform in the educational sector. We find that the platform owner deployed different logics of GenAI integration over time that were enacted through specific governance mechanisms. The shift in logics and respective governance mechanisms was triggered by a dialectic process of resistance and accommodation between platform actors. In this process, the GenAI-enabled boundary resource not only changed over time but also served as a means for the power dynamics between platform owner and complementors to be reshaped. Our study contributes to both the platform governance literature as well as recent debates around GenAI."
MMIS,2025,Are You Willing to Pay for Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) Products? Disentangling the Disclosure Effects and the Mediating Role of Psychological Value,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2487314,"While digital platform vendors are rapidly offering new generative artificial intelligence products (GAIPs), prior research on algorithmic aversion suggests that users may not respond to them the same way as to the human-generated products (HGPs). We propose that GAIPs induce psychological value, defined as a user’s intrinsic desire for a product that can influence their willingness to pay and may depend on the product type. Disclosing a product as a GAIP or HGP could further influence user reactions. From our randomized experiments with three different products representing functional, hybrid, and creative product types, we find psychological value plays an important role in creative products, such as wall art. Human disclosure shows no effect on functional or highly creative products. Our study theoretically extends the algorithmic aversion literature by illustrating the role of psychological value in GAIP highlighting the nuanced role of product type and disclosure in influencing user reactions and offering practical implications."
MMIS,2025,Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)-Based Recommender Addressing Contribution Pollution and Information Cacophony on Digital Platforms,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2487311,"Digital platforms facilitate interactions among geographically distributed users which reinforce the positive network effects. However, a disproportionate increase in the contributions of users results in contribution pollution (disproportionate increase in users’ contributions) and information cacophony (incoherence of contributions). Unaddressed, contribution pollution and information cacophony challenges have negative implications for platform efficiency and users’ humanistic outcomes. This paper highlights the limitations of existing mechanisms and proposes a framework for a generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)–based recommender system. To evaluate the efficacy of the GenAI–based recommender system, we develop an agent-based simulation model and conduct experiments using real data from three platforms (Reddit, Hacker News, and Stack Overflow).

For example, complementors lack standardized, reusable functionality that powers their applications and struggle to consistently generate desired outputs. To identify how complementors mitigate these challenges, we conducted an embedded case study of complementors in the OpenAI platform ecosystem. We identified four value co-creation mechanisms of embedded and stand-alone complements that mitigate the challenges: (1) utilizing system instructions, (2) providing context data, (3) curating user inputs, and (4) revising AI model outputs. Depending on the complement type, complementors employ these mechanisms, leverage synergies between mechanisms, and unlock previously not employable mechanisms. We contribute to research by revealing two novel logics—the reap logic and the differentiation logic—that explain how complementors co-create value by mitigating the challenges through the value co-creation mechanisms."
MMIS,2025,Effects of Nudging and Privacy Control on Online Physician Reviews: Evidence from a Field Experiment,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2487309,"Patients using healthcare services have substantial privacy concerns when writing online reviews of their physicians that may deter them from sharing information potentially helpful for others. This gives rise to a dilemma in which patients have to trade off between privacy and social welfare, leading to fewer and less informative reviews. To examine this trade off, we study how nudging strategies together with privacy control affect reviewers’ decisions related to the provision of reviews, disclosure of sensitive information, and identity revelation. We conducted a large-scale two-stage field experiment, complemented by lab experiments, to establish causality. Results reveal that nudging with an open appeal, compared to nudging with targeted benefits, increases the likelihood of patients submitting reviews. However, nudges that highlight benefits to self increase the proportion of patients revealing sensitive medical information in their reviews and the likelihood of them revealing their identity. Additionally, preemptive privacy control increases the likelihood of identity revelation without adversely impacting the sharing of sensitive information in reviews. Our findings highlight how nudging and privacy control influence patients’ review provision behavior. This study offers strategic implications for online platforms navigating the complex interplay of consumer motivations and privacy concerns in healthcare."
MMIS,2025,Job Crafting in the Context of Enterprise System Implementations,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2487305,"This paper examines employees’ job crafting in the context of enterprise system (ES) implementations. Job crafting refers to employees’ self-initiated changes aimed at improving their jobs. Drawing on self-construal and trait activation theories, we posit that personality traits associated with an independent self-construal (conscientiousness [CONSC] and openness [OPEN]) and an interdependent self-construal (agreeableness [AGREE] and extraversion [EXTRA]) promote and inhibit job crafting, respectively, with their effects moderated by ES-enabled opportunity (OPPT) and self-efficacy (SE). We further posit that job crafting increases job performance and job satisfaction. We tested our hypotheses with data from a public agency (n = 180) and a Fortune-1000 firm (n = 872). Results showed that personality traits, OPPT, and SE interacted to affect job crafting, which in turn increased job performance and job satisfaction. Our research underscores job crafting as a potent means for employees to effectively navigate ES implementations and sheds light on individual differences in job crafting motivation and behavior."
MMIS,2025,Understanding the Role of Technology in Coordination Through Affordance Configurations,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2487306,"Coordination of work activities through information exchange is fundamental and increasingly occurs over technology, yet breakdowns are frequent and lead to performance declines. Taking an episodic lens and applying configurational theorizing, we identify seven technology-enabled coordination affordances that facilitate enactment of coordination episodes. Given that coordination episodes often involve combinations of these affordances, we use qualitative comparative analysis (a technique used for configurational analysis) to identify affordance configurations associated with successful coordination. By analyzing our data and paying special attention to coordination breakdowns, we uncover how each configuration is suited to manage a specific type of coordination dependency (pooled, sequential, or kairotic). We contribute to the affordances literature by recognizing the relationship between first-order affordances, which are enabled by technology features, and affordance configurations (analogous to higher-level affordances). We contribute to coordination theory by providing new insights into how technology can augment human coordination and describe a new type of dependency (kairotic). Our work helps inform the design of systems to support coordination processes."
MMIS,2025,The Algorithm Discount: Explaining Consumers’ Valuation of Human- versus Algorithm-Created Digital Products,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2487308,"Owing to advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI), machines can now create digital products like software applications or media content, evoking calls to label such products as “AI-made.” Research on the handmade effect and algorithm aversion suggests that consumers react negatively to digital products that have been created by generative AI systems instead of humans. It is unclear why consumers show this reaction, which we refer to as “algorithm discount.” To answer this question, we conducted a mixed-methods study in the context of digital news offerings, comprising 41 qualitative interviews and a choice-based conjoint analysis with 421 respondents. The results show that consumers’ beliefs about the love and effort imbued in the product, their curiosity about algorithmically generated products, and specific product characteristics, such as the type of news article, determine the algorithm discount. These findings extend our understanding of the emergence of consumers’ aversion to algorithm-created products and offer providers of such products insight into potential countermeasures."

ISR,2025,Digital Development: Reimagining Research Beyond ICT4D,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2025.editorial.v36.n3,"This editorial introduces a conceptual framework that reimagines research on Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICT4D) as “digital development,” recognizing the inseparable intertwining of digital and development trajectories. This framing is aimed at the broader information systems (IS) research community, which includes ICT4D researchers, based both in the Global South and the Global North. Digital development encompasses three dimensions:digital in development(institutional use),digital for development(conscious design for outcomes), anddevelopment in a digital world(digital entanglement in development practice.). We argue that this reimagination is necessary for three reasons. First, digital technologies are becoming increasingly entangled with many development initiatives, implying the need to be studied as a duality, not a dualism. Second, we are witnessing the rising complexity of contemporary and emergent development challenges, which are not just limited to the Global South, but to the world at large. Third, the IS and ICT4D research fields have long worked in relative isolation from each other, but they need to synergistically create new theories and methods to address the rising complexities inherent in the “digital” and “development.” We provide a brief overview of the existing ICT4D field to identify critical areas for reconceptualization and expansion. This is then illustrated by examples from four empirical domains, namely humanitarian governance, global health, financial inclusion, and digital nomadism, which are representative of contemporary and emerging digital development challenges. This leads to the development of theoretical, policy and practice, and methodological implications, which provide a basis to formulate a research agenda for digital development."
ISR,2025,"Fashionable Consumer Technology, IT Fashion, and Consumer Behavior",https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2020.0084,"Traditionally thought of as “uncomfortable bedfellows,” consumer IT and fashion are becoming increasingly intertwined, which has given rise to a unique phenomenon termed “consumer IT fashion”—the collective enthusiasm in society for consumer technology. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain how IT fashion is perceived by individual consumers and subsequently influences consumer behavior. Our research aims to bridge this gap. By differentiating between societal-level and individual-level perceptions of IT fashion, the paper introduces novel constructs associated with IT fashion and fashionable consumer technology, particularly perceived societal-level IT fashion (PSITF, reflecting a person’s perception of society’s views on a technology) and perceived fashionableness of IT (PFIT, capturing a person’s perception of the technology’s fashionableness). Moreover, we identify drivers underlying PSITF and PFIT: collective adoption and social endorsement are the drivers of PSITF, whereas the novelty of IT and IT-identity congruity are the drivers of PFIT. A research model is developed to illustrate how IT fashion influences consumer behaviors, such as adoption and purchasing decisions. We conducted two empirical studies to assess our research model. In Study 1, we focused on consumers’ adoption decision of fashionable technology. The findings validate our conceptualization of IT fashion-related constructs and suggest that consumers are inclined to adopt fashionable IT when they believe it enhances their sense of belonging to a group (i.e., external symbolic value) and allows for self-expression (i.e., internal symbolic value). In Study 2, we explored consumers’ purchasing behavior, focusing on their willingness to pay (WTP) for a fashionable technology compared with the alternative IT product with identical functionalities. The results indicate that whereas consumers do acknowledge the symbolic values associated with using fashionable IT, these values do not necessarily translate into a greater WTP. Our research opens novel theoretical avenues for the exploration of IT fashion and lays the groundwork for future investigations in this domain."
ISR,2025,Probing Digital Footprints and Reaching for Inherent Preferences: A Cause-Disentanglement Approach to Personalized Recommendations,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0181,"The abundance of multiple types of consumer digital footprints recorded on e-commerce platforms has fueled the design of personalized recommender systems for decision support. However, capturing consumers’ inherent preferences for effective recommendations based on consumer digital footprints can be challenging because of the multitude of factors driving consumer behaviors. Model training and recommendation outcomes may become biased if other factors are inappropriately recognized as consumers’ inherent preferences in the learning process. Drawing on consumer behavior theories, we tease out various factors that drive consumers’ digital footprints at different consumption stages. We develop a novel recommendation approach, namely, DISC (Disentangling consumers’ Inherent preferences, item Salience effect, and Conformity effect), which leverages disentangled representation learning with a causal graph to derive the effect of each factor driving consumer behaviors. This approach provides personalized and interpretable recommendations based on the inference of consumers’ normative inherent preferences. The DISC model’s identifiability is demonstrated through theoretical analysis, enabling rigorous causal inference based on observational data. To evaluate DISC’s performance, extensive experiments are conducted on real-world data sets with a carefully designed protocol. The results reveal that DISC outperforms state-of-the-art baselines significantly and possesses good interpretability. Moreover, we illustrate the potential impact of different marketing strategies’ by intervening on the disentangled causes through follow-up counterfactual analyses based on the causal graph. Our study contributes to the literature and practice by causally unpacking the behavioral mechanism behind consumers’ digital footprints and designing an interpretable personalized recommendation approach anchored in their inherent preferences."
ISR,2025,Win by Hook or Crook? Self-Injecting Favorable Online Reviews to Fight Adjacent Rivals,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0179,"The existing literature has long assumed that unethical behaviors are fueled by competition. Under this premise, rivalry and competition are often treated interchangeably. This study seeks to challenge this prevailing notion by introducing a conceptual distinction between rivalry and competition. Specifically, we explore the multifaceted relationship between rivalry and unethical behaviors in the context of online review self-injecting behaviors. Drawing on the collective regulatory focus framework and deterrence theory, we posit that rivalry-induced deterrence triggers a shift in mindset from promotion focus to prevention focus, which leads to the formation of mutual forbearance in self-injecting behaviors. Mutual forbearance collapses when one party unilaterally engages in self-injection, prompting the other party to retaliate by increasing their self-injecting activities. Additionally, we propose that firm reputation plays a crucial role in reinforcing the formation of mutual forbearance while mitigating its collapse. Employing an exhaustive data set from Ctrip.com and Qunar.com that comprises 85,939 observations from 3,996 hotels and spans 2018–2020, we found that the presence of an additional rival leads to a 3.2% decrease in self-injecting intensity. Furthermore, self-injecting intensity increases by 0.095% for every 1% rise in that of the rivals and increases by 0.041% for a 1% rise in that of the nonrival competitors. Crucially, our study identifies that firm reputation acts as a significant factor that strengthens the negative relationship between the number of rivals and self-injecting intensity and weakens the positive relationship between a hotel’s self-injecting and its rival’s self-injecting intensity. These empirical findings are supported by a myriad of robust examinations, including the use of a set of subsample analyses, alternative measures of independent variables, alternative instrumental variables, alternative observation time windows, and multiple endogeneity tests. This study contributes to the literature by highlighting the pervasive and potent role of rivalry as an understudied inhibitor of self-injecting behaviors. Our empirical evidence offers critical managerial implications for platforms, sellers, and consumers."
ISR,2025,"Skill-Biased Technical Change, Again? Online Gig Platforms and Local Employment",https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0307,"Online gig platforms have the potential to influence employment in existing industries. Popular press and academic research offer two competing predictions: First, online gig platforms may reduce the supply of incumbent workers by intensifying competition and obsoleting certain skills of workers; or, second, they may boost the supply of workers by increasing client-worker matching efficiency and creating new employment opportunities for workers. Yet, there has been limited understanding of the labor movements amid the rise of online gig platforms. Extending the skill-biased technical change literature, we study the impact of TaskRabbit—alocation-basedgig platform that matches freelance workers to local demand for domestic tasks (e.g., cleaning services)—on the local supply of incumbent, work-for-wages housekeeping workers. We also examine the heterogeneous effects across workers at different skill levels. Exploiting the staggered TaskRabbit expansion into U.S. cities, we identify a significant decrease in the number of incumbent housekeeping workers after TaskRabbit entry. Notably, this is mainly driven by a disproportionate decline in the number of middle-skilled workers (i.e., first-line managers, supervisors) whose tasks could easily be automated by TaskRabbit’s matching algorithms, but not low-skilled workers (i.e., janitors, cleaners) who typically perform manual tasks. Interestingly, TaskRabbit entry doesnotnecessarily crowd out middle-skilled housekeeping workers, neither laying them off nor forcing them to other related occupations; rather, TaskRabbit entry supports self-employment within the housekeeping industry. These findings imply that online gig platforms may not naively be viewed as skill biased, especially for low-skilled workers; instead, theyredistributemiddle-skilled managerial workers whose cognitive tasks are automated by the sorting and matching algorithms to explore new self-employment opportunities for workers, stressing the need to reconsider online gig platforms as a means to reshape existing industries and stimulate entrepreneurial endeavors."
ISR,2025,An Experimental Evaluation of Gender Differences in Responses to Major-Donor Funding Schemes for Crowdfunded Social Ventures,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0318,"Social ventures fundraising through crowdfunding compete for contributions. Thus, they often involve major donors to influence the contributions of smaller donors. We examine what type of major-donor contribution scheme is most likely to attract smaller donors, considering whether and to what degree male and female donors differ in their response to alternative major-donor contribution schemes that are commonly used in practice. In a field experiment, donors were randomly assigned to receive one of three solicitation messages about projects seeking funds through crowdfunding. All donors received identical messages, with the exception that information on major-donor involvement was varied across conditions. The message to the control group made no mention of a major donor. The seed group was informed that a major donor had unconditionally funded the first 50% of the projects’ costs and that the projects were collecting the remaining 50% from other donors; we hypothesize that this scheme is likely to appeal to female donors, who tend to be more uncertainty and risk averse. Finally, the challenge-match group was informed that a major donor would provide the remaining 50% of the projects’ costs after the projects secure the first 50% from other donors; we hypothesize that this scheme is likely to appeal to male donors, who tend to respond more positively to challenges. The major donor in the field experiment—Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft—is an Austrian government agency that promotes and funds innovation. We find that females in the seed group are ∼50% and ∼35% more likely to exhibit an interest in contributing as compared with females in the control or challenge-match conditions, respectively. Among males, we do not observe significant differences in interest in contributing across the three groups. Survey results indicate that females are more responsive to the seed scheme because it yields a perception that the organization conducting the project is of high quality, is likely to reach its funding goal, and is likely to achieve its implementation goals. Our study suggests that social ventures will be more successful at attracting contributions from female donors if a major donor kicks off the campaign with an initial, unconditional contribution."
ISR,2025,Untangling the Performance Impact of E-marketplace Sellers’ Deployment of Platform-Based Functions: A Configurational Perspective,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2020.0539,"Previous studies have shown great interest in examining the performance impact of platform-based functions (PBFs) used by e-marketplace sellers and the contingent role of salient variables, such as seller reputation, in the e-marketplace. Their findings, however, are fragmented and inconsistent, as they generally focus on the net, separate effect of a single PBF with debatable findings. The theorization of how sellers should configure multiple types of PBFs as a whole to achieve high sales performance lags far behind the booming competition practice. To identify an effective PBF combination, this study takes a configurational perspective to identify appropriate PBF configurations that can achieve high sales performance for sellers with different product positions and reputations. A fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis of a longitudinal data set of over 3,300 apparel sellers in a large e-marketplace yields interesting findings. The configuration results reveal recipes for PBF combinations for achieving high sales performance that vary across different levels of seller reputation and product positioning strategies. Our configuration findings suggest that sellers should configure PBFs according to distinctive product strategies accompanied by seller reputation conditions, where the resulting PBF configurations play an essential and multifaceted role in achieving high sales performances. Interestingly, our configuration analysis uncovers that for reputable sellers offering high-priced products, the utilization of pricing and marketing functions is counterproductive. Additionally, we observe complex interplays between after-sales functions and online reputation, characterized by complementary, substitutive, and independent relationships. Furthermore, our results demonstrate an asymmetry relationship between high and low sales configurations. It contributes to the emergent investigation of causal complexity in competitive strategy studies of e-marketplace sellers and provides specific causal recipes and holistic guidelines for sellers and platform operators."
ISR,2025,Return of the Movie Night? Analyzing the Impact of Netflix Subscriptions on Offline Movie Spending,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0530,"The subscription-based business model is disruptive in the copyright industries. More than a digitalized distribution channel, it fundamentally transforms both supply and demand sides by offering new forms of content creation, provision, and consumption. However, the effects of these business models on the local offline industry are less well understood, especially in the case of the motion picture industry. This study investigates the impact of the subscription-based business model on offline activity consumption in the motion picture industry. Leveraging a unique data set with individuals’ every transaction record and a difference-in-differences approach, we show that Netflix subscription interestingly increases offline movie consumption. Based on the argument that individuals have unmet social and hedonic demands that are imperfectly met by subscription-based services, like Netflix, we show that offline movie consumption actually increases postsubscription, accompanied by social and hedonic activities, like dining and entertainment spending. We also provide evidence that the identified positive effect on offline movie consumption is more pronounced for individuals with higher social and hedonic needs (i.e., lower-income people and younger people). Our work provides clear implications for managers and policymakers who are involved in both subscription-based platforms, like Netflix, and the traditional offline movie industry. In addition, we provide theoretical implications for the study of subscription-based platforms, the imperfect substitution of channels, and the role of social and hedonic value in technology-supported platforms."
ISR,2025,To Partner or Not to Partner? The Partnership Between Platforms and Data Brokers in Two-Sided Markets,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0470,"Data have become an important competitive asset, especially for online advertising platforms, leading to the emergence of a new data broker industry. Platforms can partner with data brokers to acquire external data to enhance their targeting capabilities, but this practice has stoked growing consumer privacy concerns. This study develops a game-theoretic model to examine the economic mechanism underlying the partnership between competing platforms and a data broker in a two-sided market. Interestingly, our analysis shows that increasing consumer privacy concerns caused by the data broker may encourage platforms to partner with the data broker rather than discourage them. The driving force is that, because of negative cross-side network effects from advertisers to consumers, increased privacy concerns can serve as a strategic lever to soften price competition on the advertiser side. However, when both platforms partner with the data broker, a prisoner’s dilemma may arise in equilibrium even when the data broker can greatly improve the targeting capabilities. We find that the platform-data broker partnership hurts consumer surplus when platforms adopt a pure ad-sponsored model without charging consumers, but it may benefit consumer surplus when platforms adopt a mixed model with ad-sponsored and subscription-based revenue. Moreover, our analysis indicates that platforms may not have incentives to adopt high levels of privacy protection and may instead adopt asymmetric privacy protection strategies, with one platform adopting high privacy protection and the other opting for low protection. A series of model extensions confirm the robustness of our key findings. We conclude with a discussion of managerial and policy implications."
ISR,2025,Player-vs.-Player Game Design and Pricing: A Tournament Design Perspective,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0258,"Player-versus-player (PvP) games often allow users to purchase superior virtual gears to increase their winning odds in battles against others. This game design, known as “pay to win,” generates substantial revenues from paying players, but it may also adversely affect the gaming experience of nonpaying players and lead to a decline in the game’s popularity. Game developers thus need to strike a balance between revenue and player participation. This paper develops a model to analyze optimal versioning and pricing strategies for PvP games. Building on the classic product line design framework with network effects, we allow a monopolistic game developer to strategically manipulate gameplay (dis-)advantages across different versions, which we refer to as tournament design, and this generates version-specific network effects. We characterize the developer’s optimal strategy and obtain the following insights. First, tournament design improves the developer’s flexibility in pricing and versioning, and it effectively mitigates the extent of product cannibalization. Second, tournament design enables the developer to monetize free players’ participation by offering multiple free versions, and a “freemium” strategy (i.e., the combination of a free-to-play model and a pay-to-win system) can arise in the optimum. Third, tournament design is particularly effective in increasing the developer’s profit when players are willing to play the game but are reluctant to pay. Fourth, tournament design leads to a Pareto improvement for both the developer and all players. The practical implications of these findings are also discussed."
ISR,2025,An Explainable Artificial Intelligence Approach Using Graph Learning to Predict Intensive Care Unit Length of Stay,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0029,"Intensive care units (ICUs) are critical for treating severe health conditions but represent significant hospital expenditures. Accurate prediction of ICU length of stay (LoS) can enhance hospital resource management, reduce readmissions, and improve patient care. In recent years, widespread adoption of electronic health records and advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have facilitated accurate predictions of ICU LoS. However, there is a notable gap in the literature on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods that identify interactions between model input features to predict patient health outcomes. This gap is especially noteworthy as the medical literature suggests that complex interactions between clinical features are likely to significantly impact patient health outcomes. We propose a novel graph learning-based approach that offers state-of-the-art prediction and greater interpretability for ICU LoS prediction. Specifically, our graph-based XAI model can generate interaction-based explanations supported by evidence-based medicine, which provide rich patient-level insights compared with existing XAI methods. We test the statistical significance of our XAI approach using a distance-based separation index and utilize perturbation analyses to examine the sensitivity of our model explanations to changes in input features. Finally, we validate the explanations of our graph learning model using the conceptual evaluation property (Co-12) framework and a small-scale user study of ICU clinicians. Our approach offers interpretable predictions of ICU LoS grounded in design science research, which can facilitate greater integration of AI-enabled decision support systems in clinical workflows, thereby enabling clinicians to derive greater value."
ISR,2025,Should Ad Exchanges Subsidize Advertisers to Acquire Targeting Data?,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0126,"Large volumes of online impressions are sold daily via real-time auctions to deliver targeted advertisements to consumers. Advertisers use data to learn about user preferences and select the most appropriate ad for each user, which also helps them optimize their bids in an ad auction. Although ad exchanges may provide some user data to advertisers, they are usually limited, and advertisers often acquire data from various sources to improve targeting performance. The acquisition of such data can significantly influence the revenue of the ad exchange, which motivates ad exchanges to take actions that reduce advertisers’ data acquisition costs and encourage them to buy data. Previous studies have examined the impact of ad exchanges revealing their data to advertisers, but little attention has been paid to the impact of ad exchanges subsidizing advertisers to acquire data from third parties. To address this gap, we propose three subsidy frameworks to increase ad exchange revenue by inducing more advertisers to acquire data: all subsidized (AS), winner subsidized (WS), and loser subsidized. Using a stylized model, we analyze the impact of subsidy provisions on the platform’s net revenue. Our results show that WS can be better or worse than AS depending on the cost of data acquisition, its beneficial impact on ad selection, and the distribution of impression values."
ISR,2025,Identity Work in Interdependent Professional Groups: The Role of a Target Identity in Enterprise Systems Implementation,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0534,"Enterprise systems (ESs) can be important for the development and maintenance of professional role identities. Prior work shows that a new ES implementation can trigger significant identity work in individuals and groups if it alters their tasks or responsibilities. What has received less attention is that the introduction of a new ES may affect multiple, interdependent professional groups simultaneously, changing how these professional groups can or must interact based on the system properties. Consequently, the introduction of a new ES may also affect how these groups maintain distinctive professional role identities. This study examines how the introduction of a new ES affects the identity work of interdependent professional groups in an organization. Drawing on a revelatory context, we studied the identity work of management accountants and financial accountants in six cases where a new ES merged traditionally separate financial and management accounting modules into one general accounting module. To understand the emergent identity work, we present the construct of a target identity (i.e., a tentative enhanced professional role identity that professional groups actively strive to achieve) and describe three patterns of identity work. We derive five propositions about the conditions under which interdependent professional groups develop a target identity, about the consequences of (not) achieving a target identity, and about the willingness of interdependent professional groups to renegotiate their role boundaries."
ISR,2025,Resale Royalty in Non-Fungible Token Marketplaces: Blessing or Burden for Creators and Platforms?,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0035,"Non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces enable users to mint and trade digital assets, such as collectibles, trading cards, and digital artwork. Many of these platforms accommodate resale royalties, which return a predetermined percentage of the proceeds from future resales of the digital asset to the creator. Although the adoption of resale royalties may seem beneficial for NFT creators by providing a recurring source of income, it could have unintended consequences on the sales price and the liquidity of the underlying NFT, potentially affecting both the platform’s commission revenue and the creator’s short-term return. In this paper, we aim to understand the antecedents and consequences of resale royalties. Specifically, we empirically investigate the impact of minting costs on royalty rates and subsequently, the effects of resale royalties on primary market sales prices and liquidity. Our identification strategy combines a difference-in-differences model that leverages a policy change that eliminated up-front minting fees for creators and an instrumental variables approach. We find that NFT creators reduce royalty rates when they mint an NFT without incurring minting costs. Furthermore, we observe that higher royalty rates lead to reduced sales prices in the primary market, suggesting the presence of adelayed gratification effectas creators hope for future royalty payments. We also investigate the underlying mechanisms, and we find that NFT creators who are more confident about future resales tend to lower their primary sale prices but are unable to recoup those losses in the short term, providing evidence of anoverconfidence effect. Surprisingly, we find that the presence of resale royalties also negatively affects market liquidity despite reduced sales prices. Our findings offer immediate implications for creators and platforms regarding resale royalty strategies and whether to enforce royalties."
ISR,2025,And No One Gets the Short End of the Stick: A Blockchain-Based Approach to Solving the Two-Sided Opportunism Problem in Interorganizational Information Sharing,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0065,"The threat of opportunistic behavior is an enduring problem in interorganizational information sharing based on sensitive data. The two sides of opportunism in interorganizational information sharing—information poachingby the information recipient andinformation manipulationby the information provider—may preclude beneficial information sharing relationships altogether. Previously proposed organizational and technical countermeasures against the threat of opportunism either fail to reliably prevent information poaching and manipulation or prevent only one of them at a time. To address these shortcomings, we develop three design principles for an information system that facilitates reliable information sharing based on sensitive data in interorganizational business transactions without revealing the actual data. We instantiate our design principles in a multicompany research consortium for wear-based leasing contracts for machine tools. Through in-depth interview sessions with business and technology experts, we demonstrate the efficacy of our artifact in addressing the two-sided opportunism problem. A survey-based evaluation of the artifact’s utility in the context of machine tool leasing shows that organizations are willing to engage in more interorganizational information sharing, rely more on shared information, and draw on more sensitive data when provided with our solution. The study makes three key contributions. First, it contributes to the literature on interorganizational information sharing by identifying information poaching and information manipulation as two sides of the same problem and by showing empirically that opportunities for beneficial business arise if both forms of opportunism are addressed simultaneously. Second, our design principles constitute a blueprint of a shared information system that enables reliable (i.e., verifiably truthful) information sharing between business partners without revealing the data underlying the shared information. Third, the study contributes to the literature on blockchain systems by recombining specific blockchain technology components, namely, private data collections, smart contracts, and joint governance, in a useful, novel way."
ISR,2025,How Product Display Orientation Affects Customers’ Choice Satisfaction in Online Purchase: A Choice Closure Perspective,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0575,"Online retailers often confront the problem of order cancellation due to customers’ poor satisfaction with their online purchase decision, termed aschoice satisfactionin this study. However, very little e-commerce literature has addressed customer choice satisfaction, and none, to our knowledge, has investigated how to design product display interfaces to achieve it. Drawing from choice closure theory and eye and vision research, we examine how product display orientation of an online shopping web page affects customers’ choice satisfaction upon purchase. We propose that a horizontal (versus vertical) display of comparable products on an e-commerce website is more positively related to customer choice satisfaction by promoting a higher level of choice closure (a psychological process by which online customers come to perceive a decision as completed and settled). Through five carefully designed experiments (including one using an eye-tracking device), we find that online customers achieve a higher level of choice satisfaction from an assortment of comparable products displayed horizontally than vertically on e-commerce websites. This effect results from the fact that a horizontal product display increases the amount of comparisons customers make between product options prior to making a purchase decision and consequential sense of choice closure after the decision. We also find that a cue of finality (e.g., adding a textual note “The end” to the product display) can largely attenuate this effect. The implications for online retailers’ product showcase strategies are discussed, along with future research directions."
ISR,2025,Mergers Between On-Demand Service Platforms: The Impact on Consumer Surplus and Labor Welfare,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0553,"On-demand service platforms connect customers with independent service providers (agents) by competitively setting service prices and wages. Mergers between on-demand service platforms have recently become prevalent, resulting in antitrust debates. A merger, although reducing competition, enables the agents on previously separate platforms to serve all the customers. In this paper, we develop a game-theoretical model to analyze the impact of a merger between two platforms. The two platforms compete on prices and wages before the merger, but are managed by a single firm after the merger. We show that a merger not only creates pooling benefits, but also enhances the cross-side network effect (i.e., customers benefit from more agents and vice versa). As a result, it can lead to a win-win-win outcome, where the platforms’ profits, consumer surplus, and labor welfare all improve after a merger. The win-win-win outcome is more probable if the premerger market is less saturated or if the market is more differentiated on the customer/agent side. Interestingly, a stronger within-side congestion effect may either strengthen or weaken a merger’s potential to benefit customers. Additionally, we show that a merger is less likely to improve consumer surplus and labor welfare if there are more multihoming agents in the market and that it is more likely to benefit labor welfare if there is less cross-side price transparency. Our results provide guidelines for antitrust policymakers to evaluate the impact of a merger between on-demand service platforms."
ISR,2025,Two-Sided Impacts of Service Provider’s Identity Disclosure in e-Customer Service Platforms: Evidence from Two Field Experiments,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0499,"Digital advancements have revolutionized customer service by enabling customers to easily express dissatisfaction and request resolutions through online platforms. Customer complaint management platforms are especially unique in facilitating provider-customer interactions, but researchers overlook implications from service provider anonymity. In this article, two randomized field experiments are conducted to examine a customer complaint management platform to identify how disclosure of service provider identity affects service performance, customer satisfaction, and biases in customers. Study 1, a large-scale randomized field experiment involving 75,041 customers and 1,280 service providers across 672 companies, finds that identity disclosure improves provider performance. This improvement is achieved by removing the provider’s dissociative anonymity, mitigating deindividuation, instilling self-awareness, and motivating personal responsibility. This effect is stronger for inexperienced service providers who work with many colleagues and have more discretion in handling complaints. Customers who receive identity details about providers benefit from better service and perceive higher satisfaction with complaint resolution. Study 2, a field experiment involving 2,710 customers, shows that customers report more satisfaction when customers identify that providers belong to the majority ethnic group compared with when they belong to an ethnic minority. Intriguingly, minority customers showed lower satisfaction with same-ethnicity providers, indicating that ethnic cues and identity matching significantly influence customer satisfaction. Four follow-up studies involving 1,211 participants identify the underlying mechanisms that influence customer and provider behaviors. The article concludes with practical implications for firms and platforms dedicated to customer service."
ISR,2025,Lost Time in Crowdsourcing Contests,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0502,"Crowdsourcing contests have become increasingly popular as a means of seeking innovative solutions to business problems. However, the abundance of concurrent contests on platforms can lead to disparities in solvers’ contest awareness, resulting in “lost time”—the time elapsed between the start of a contest and a solver’s first visit. This study investigates how lost time influences solvers’ submission behavior and its subsequent impact on matching inefficacy as measured by solver disqualification, which occurs when a solver fails to produce a submission meeting the seeker’s baseline criteria. Utilizing a proprietary data set from a European crowdsourcing platform, we employ a mediation analysis framework to examine the relationship between lost time and two key dimensions of submission behavior: time to first submission and number of submissions. Our findings reveal that higher levels of lost time are associated with fewer submissions, indicating reduced solver persistence. However, this negative effect is partially mitigated by solvers’ faster initial submissions when facing lost time. Importantly, we demonstrate that changes in submission behavior fully mediate the negative impact of lost time on solver disqualification, highlighting the crucial role of submission behavior in influencing solver disqualification. Furthermore, we provide evidence supporting latecomer disadvantage as an important mechanism driving solvers’ behavioral responses to lost time. Our study contributes to the crowdsourcing literature by uncovering the impact of lost time on solvers’ behavior and performance, offering valuable insights for contest design. By understanding and mitigating the effects of latecomer disadvantage, platforms can enhance the effectiveness of crowdsourcing in solving problems."
ISR,2025,Growing Platforms by Adding Complementors Without a Contract,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0237,"Multisided platforms often pursue growth strategies of expanding participants on one side (e.g., suppliers) and leveraging the cross-side network effect to attract participants on other sides (e.g., consumers). Whereas formal contractual agreements have traditionally been the norm for onboarding suppliers, an emerging trend involves platforms enabling consumers to interact with noncontracted suppliers via third-party enablers with both sharing profits from providing complementary services. This study examines this strategy of increasing market thickness in the context of food delivery platforms, focusing on the platforms’ inclusion of restaurants as “nonpartnered” restaurants. Nonpartnered restaurants do not pay commission fees for being listed on the platforms and do not control their menu or item prices. The platforms collect and transfer consumer orders to the third-party deliverers who place the order, pick it up, and deliver the food to consumers. The strategy has drawn regulatory scrutiny regarding its potential harm to nonpartnered restaurants and consumers. This research empirically investigates the impact of this noncontracted partnership on restaurants, leveraging two natural experiments: (1) a number of nonpartnered restaurants were listed on the platform, and (2) the restaurants were later delisted because of a governmental regulation. Our findings show that being added as a nonpartnered restaurant increases these restaurants’ revenue from takeout orders by about $1,410 per month. Adding nonpartnered restaurants also has a positive spillover effect on the revenue of partnered restaurants already on the platform. Finally, the delisting of nonpartnered restaurants leads to a drop in their takeout orders as well as a negative spillover on the revenue of partnered restaurants. In essence, a nonpartnered contract benefits most restaurants, especially independent restaurants. These insights can inform the design of platform and regulatory policies related to noncontracted growth strategies."
ISR,2025,An Investigation ofp-Hacking in E-Commerce A/B Testing,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2024.0872,"In recent years, randomized experiments (or “A/B tests”) have become commonplace in many industrial settings as managers increasingly seek the aid of scientific rigor in their decision making. However, just as this practice has proliferated among firms, the problem ofp-hacking—whereby experimenters adjust their sample size or try several statistical analyses until they find one that produces a statistically significantp-value—has emerged as a prevalent concern in the scientific community. Notably, many commentators have highlighted how A/B testing software enables and may even encouragep-hacking behavior. To investigate this phenomenon, we analyze the prevalence ofp-hacking in a primary sample of 2,270 experiments conducted by 242 firms on a large U.S.-based e-commerce A/B testing platform. Using multiple statistical techniques—including a novel approach we call theasymmetric caliper test—we analyze thep-values corresponding to each experiment’s designated target metric across multiple significance thresholds. Our findings reveal essentially no evidence forp-hacking in our data. In an extended sample that examinesp-hacking across all outcome metrics (encompassing more than 16,000p-values in total), we similarly observe no evidence ofp-hacking behavior. We use simulations to determine that if a modest effect ofp-hacking were present in our data set, our methods would have the power to detect it at our current sample size. We contrast our results with the prevalence ofp-hacking in academic contexts and discuss a number of possible factors explaining the divergent results, highlighting the potential roles of organizational learning and economic incentives."
ISR,2025,Walrasian Pricing for Combinatorial Markets with Compact-Bidding Languages: An Application to Truckload Transportation,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0676,"Combinatorial auctions offer several economic advantages but also face multiple technical challenges, including bid generation, the need to solve a combinatorial allocation problem, and determining reasonable prices. These challenges are even more pronounced in a combinatorial exchange, where bidders can simultaneously buy and sell combinations of goods. Motivated by truckload transportation markets, we explore new mechanisms for finding linear and anonymous Walrasian equilibrium prices in combinatorial auctions and exchanges where bidders can use a compact-bidding language to express their potentially complex preferences. With the goal of improving economic efficiency and reducing the environmental impact of the trucking industry, we identify significant potential gains by developing a method for integrated allocation and price determination based on an industry-specific bidding language. We also demonstrate our proposed mechanism’s adaptability and flexibility by considering a number of practical constraints."
ISR,2025,Team Makes You Better: Evidence from Online Medical Consultation Platforms,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0689,"Virtual teamwork has become a prevalent mode of collaboration. However, scant empirical attention has been given to the impact of virtual teamwork on individual members’ performance beyond the team setting. In this paper, we fill this gap by studying virtual teams in the context of online medical consultation (OMC) platforms. Specifically, we collect data from two OMC platforms during a time period when both platforms offered individual consultations (i.e., one patient connected with one physician) but only one offered team consultations (i.e., one patient connected with a team of physicians). Using a difference-in-difference-in-differences approach, we find that team participation has a robust, positive effect on physicians’ performance in individual consultations. We further explore the potential mechanisms through which team participation improves physicians’ performance. The empirical results indicate that the observed performance improvement is likely driven by peer effects in team settings. In particular, we find that physicians exert more effort in individual consultations after joining a team and that performance improvement is stronger when (1) a physician can easily observe the performance of the physician’s teammates (peers), (2) a physician has teammates (peers) who perform well in individual consultations, (3) a physician has teammates (peers) from the same hospital or the same city, or (4) a physician has a lower performance prior to joining in a team. Our findings shed new light on the boundary-spanning roles of virtual teams and provide timely insights into the ongoing development of OMC platforms."
ISR,2025,A Natural Disaster Reshapes Prosocial Microlending,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0723,"Previous studies have investigated how various factors influence prosocial microlending decisions under normal circumstances. Nevertheless, a natural disaster may result in a situation where lenders can hardly find appropriate loans from the disaster-affected region. When faced with the mismatch between the supply and demand of microloans, lenders can either simply choose not to make any contributions or divert their prosocial intentions toward a different group of beneficiaries. Drawing on the motivated information processing theory, we show that the outcome-focused nature of prosocial motivation drives lenders to seek alternative loans until they achieve the goal of helping others, and the other-focused psychological process prompts lenders to take the victims’ perspectives when deciding which loans to fund. Moreover, lenders’ attention paid to the surrounding regions is distributed in a gradient fashion associated with their geographical distance to the disaster. Using a natural experiment based on the Ebola outbreak in Africa in 2014, our research shows that a natural disaster increases (over the short-term) the average contribution size and decreases (over the long-term) the average fundraising time per dollar for prosocial microloans by borrowers from regions closer to the affected region. In contrast, a natural disaster decreases (over the long-term) the average contribution size and increases (over the long-term) the average fundraising time per dollar for prosocial microloans by borrowers from regions farther away from the affected region. This redistribution of prosocial microlending is an unintended consequence of a natural disaster that inflicts long-term economic hardship in some regions. Policymakers and researchers should closely monitor the redistribution of prosocial microlending resulting from a natural disaster so that prompt action can be taken to alleviate potential negative consequences that may arise."
ISR,2025,Do Reductions in Search Costs for Partial Information on Online Platforms Lead to Better Consumer Decisions? Evidence of Cognitive Miser Behavior from a Natural Experiment,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0432,"Many online platforms have utilized information technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI), to reduce consumers’ information search costs and facilitate their decision-making processes. Given the variety of online information, these technologies are often effective in reducing the search cost for only specific information types: a concept we refer to as search cost reduction for partial information. For rational consumers, this can lead to improved decision making. However, consumers do not always behave rationally and may exhibit behavioral biases in their decision-making process. In this study, we propose that search cost reduction for partial information can induce cognitive miser behavior in consumers, ultimately leading to worse decision-making. To explore this understudied puzzle, we leverage a natural experiment on Yelp to examine the effect of enabling search cost reduction for partial information on the quality of consumers’ decisions regarding restaurants. We constructed a unique panel data set using matched pairs of restaurants across Yelp and TripAdvisor. By applying a difference-in-differences design, we aim to casually infer how consumer decision quality is affected following the introduction of Yelp’s new AI-powered image categorization feature in August 2015, which was designed to reduce the search cost of review images. We find that adding the AI-powered image categorization feature has a negative effect on consumer decision quality. Delving into the text analysis of consumer complaints using deep learning techniques, we further find that the inferior decision quality of consumers postfeature introduction is primarily due to reduced awareness of restaurants’ service quality—information that is readily available in review texts but not in review images. Our findings suggest that reducing search costs for partial information may hurt consumers as it may incentivize cognitive miser behavior. This occurs as consumers disproportionately pay attention to the product information of which the search cost has been reduced, whereas paying less attention to other relevant product information. We discuss the implications of these findings for online platforms."
ISR,2025,The Death of a Technical Skill,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0709,"We analyze how the decline of a technology affects online labor market dynamics. We evaluate the effects of Steve Jobs’ announcement that Apple would no longer support Adobe Flash—a popular set of tools for creating internet applications. Despite a precipitous decline in Flash demand, there is no evidence of a reduction in Flash wages on this platform because the supply response was rapid, particularly among younger developers with readily available “fallback” skills. The key to this rapid adjustment was that the long-run value of the skills that developers expected to acquire on the job acted as a form of nonwage compensation that suddenly fell in its expected value, motivating many developers to switch to other technologies, even though wages themselves did not fall. Our findings underscore how the rise and fall of technologies influences matching in online markets and help to explain (i) why technological obsolescence leaves fewer, older participants in a skill and (ii) why technologies in decline can be contemporaneously characterized by wages that stay flat or even rise in a market setting. Management and policy implications are discussed."
ISR,2025,Push It Cross the Finish Line—Designing Online Interfaces to Induce Choice Closure at the Postdecision Prepurchase Stage,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0085,"As e-commerce and mobile commerce become prevalent, a notable issue indicating a lack of choice closure is that consumers do not complete their purchases after choosing a product (e.g., shopping cart abandonment). Choice closure refers to the psychological process by which decision makers come to perceive a decision to be complete and settled. To foster choice closure, online interface designs hold promising merits in terms of flexible implementations and practical implications. Drawing upon cognitive dissonance theory and self-justification theory, we examine how interface designs can tackle consumers’ negative cognitions to promote choice closure at the postdecision prepurchase stage, whereas the extant literature focuses mainly on enhancing consumers’ positive cognitions leading to their decision satisfaction. Particularly, we investigate the effects of online interface designs on reducing cognitive dissonance (i.e., a negative cognition as an antecedent of perceived choice closure) and examine the relationships between this construct, perceived choice closure, and decision satisfaction. We conducted a series of controlled experiments in a simulated e-commerce site by designing and presenting interface cues as direct and social decision reinforcements at a postdecision prepurchase stage. Our results attest to (1) the effectiveness of the proposed reinforcement cues for inducing choice closure via reduced cognitive dissonance and (2) the significant role of choice closure for consumers’ satisfaction with their decisions in online settings where product consumption/testing is often unfeasible. Theoretical and practical contributions are elaborated."
ISR,2025,Follow Your Heart or Listen to Users? The Case of Mobile App Design,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0060,"Firms strive to improve their products over time to compete effectively in the market. Typically, firms update their products by adding novel or differentiating features or by imitating competitors. With the ubiquity of social media, there is also the opportunity to obtain customer input on their preferred features for a product. In the case of mobile apps, user feedback in the form of reviews may include suggestions of novel features or those that are already present in competing apps but not in the focal app. Leveraging the information contained in reviews and version release notes of iOS apps, we develop a deep learning–based natural language processing approach to identify four types of app features: developer-initiated novel, developer-initiated imitative, user-suggested novel, and user-suggested imitative. We evaluate the impact of these feature categories on app demand. Our results demonstrate that only developer-initiated novel and user-suggested imitative features help increase app demand. We also find that the impact of user-suggested novel features is negative. However, this negative effect is limited to features that are contextually distant from user suggestions, whereas contextually close implementations have a positive effect. Although we observe that the aggregate impact of developer-initiated imitative features is statistically insignificant, features that are slightly modified from the original apps do have a positive effect on demand. The primary contribution of our study is to investigate user reviews as a source of ideas for new features and to evaluate their performance impacts relative to those of developer-initiated features."
ISR,2025,Leveraging Context: Re-Thinking Research Processes to Make “Contributions to Theory”,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0048,"The ever-changing technology landscape has information systems (IS) researchers constantly facing new phenomena, especially in new settings, that must be understood. To address this challenge, building on calls for contextualization, this commentary complements prior works on contextualization and presents guidance within four general research steps—defining the problem, anchoring to prior research, seeking novelty, and reporting practices—in order to achieve rigorous contextualization. In doing this, the basic idea of scientific contribution in IS research is expanded from (a) the typical contribution of theory to the phenomenon (more than 80% of IS research articles from 2018 to 2021 fromInformation Systems Research, Journal of the Association for Information Systems,andMIS Quarterly) to (b) include the less common contribution to theory, especially reference discipline theory, thus creating the opportunity for IS research to be more impactful and IS to grow as a reference discipline. Finally, guidelines for editors and reviewers are offered to facilitate the publication of impactful contextualized research."
ISR,2025,Customer Engagement Prediction on Social Media: A Graph Neural Network Method,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0281,"With the rapid prevalence and massive user growth of social media platforms, efficiently targeting potential customers on these platforms has grown in importance for companies. Enhancing the likelihood that a social media user will engage with brand posts holds profound implications for online marketing strategy design. However, predicting customer engagement on social media comes with its own set of challenges. In this work, we design a graph neural network model called the graph neural network with attention mechanism for customer engagement (GACE) to predict customer engagement (like/comment/share) of brand posts. We exploit large-scale content consumption information from the perspective of heterogeneous networks and learn latent customer representation by developing a graph neural network model. We examine GACE using a large-scale Facebook data set, and the comprehensive results show significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we conduct an interpretability analysis, which sheds some light on the explanation of the proposed model. To illustrate the practical significance of our work, we provide examples to quantify the economic value of improved predictive power using a cost-revenue analysis in the context of targeted marketing."
ISR,2025,Flow of the Game: A Hidden Markov Model of Player Engagement in Online Mobile Games,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0217,"With the rapid development of mobile technology and consumers’ increasing demand for portability, the mobile gaming market has experienced huge growth. To ensure the success of mobile games, game publishers need to keep their players engaged and, at the same time, seek monetization strategies that do not interrupt players’ engagement. This paper examines how in-game challenge-related factors (i.e., perceived challenge and fluctuation of perceived challenge) and a novel mobile game monetization strategy—reward ads—affect players’ engagement. Reward ads, a popular in-app advertising monetization model in which players can voluntarily watch an ad in exchange for a reward within the game, can help publishers generate revenue without breaking the flow of the game. We develop a Hidden Markov Model and employ detailed tap-stream data from a mobile game app to study how challenge-related factors and reward ads affect players’ dynamic engagement state evolution. First, we find that players’ perceived challenge level has a positive, but diminishing, marginal effect on players’ engagement state transitions. Second, a higher fluctuation of perceived challenge increases the probability that players move to a higher engagement state. Third, the scaffolding earned by watching reward ads can help players transition to a higher engagement level. Furthermore, we study the moderating effect of perceived challenge on reward ads, and we find that reward ads are more helpful in engaging players when the perceived challenge is higher. The findings enhance the understanding of players’ engagement with mobile games and provide design guidance for mobile game publishers."
ISR,2025,The Impact of Mobile Data Cost on Consumer Price Sensitivity: A Study of a Hotel Booking App,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0450,"The rapid advancement of mobile internet technologies, such as 4G and 5 G, has greatly enhanced the accessibility and convenience of mobile shopping. However, along with these benefits, mobile data usage has introduced a novel form of search cost in consumers’ purchasing decisions compared with Wi-Fi. This arises from the perception that mobile data are more costly because of additional charges incurred when exceeding the fixed data quota, which contributes to the increase of mental cost during the search process. To examine the influence of mobile data cost on consumer price sensitivity, we conduct empirical research utilizing hotel search data obtained from a prominent hotel booking app. Our findings reveal that consumers exhibit approximately twice the level of price sensitivity when utilizing mobile data instead of Wi-Fi, resulting in an average US$17 less in revenue per hotel booking. To assess the causal relations between mobile data cost and consumer price sensitivity, we utilize an approach similar to difference-in-differences and observe that this impact is more pronounced when consumers book hotels at the end of the month (versus the beginning of the month). We further find that consumer search effort decreases when using mobile data (versus Wi-Fi) across decision stages of the search process, supporting the mechanism that mobile data cost drives consumers into the satisficing rather than maximizing search mode. Our research offers practical implications for businesses operating in mobile shopping environments and contributes to policy development in this field."
ISR,2025,From Anonymity to Accountability: How Virtual Identity Disclosure Changes the Quantity and Quality of “Likes”,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2020.0335,"An integral component of user participation in community-based platforms is giving “likes” to content posted by others. At the same time, online social participation differs from offline social participation in that online users are often allowed to create a virtual identity unrelated to their real-world identity. The objective of this study is to identify the motivations behind users’ giving “likes” when their virtual identity (i.e., username) is hidden or shown. Specifically, we leverage a natural experiment to examine the effect of virtual identity disclosure on users’ “liking” behavior. Our identification strategy relies on an exogenous policy change in an online community-based platform, where likers’ username was not visible before but publicly shown after the change. Our results show that users “liked” fewer but higher-quality articles after the policy change, consistent with their protective self-presentation motivation. This study emphasizes the significance of virtual identity, arguing that a virtual identity devoid of real-world information should not be equated with anonymity. It also underscores the importance of protective self-presentation over acquisitive self-presentation, suggesting that research should focus not only on the actions users take but also on those they intentionally avoid taking. Furthermore, our study identifies “liking” as a key channel of self-presentation, complementing the focus on posting behaviors in the extant literature. Practically, platforms can refine their policies on virtual identity disclosure to enhance content engagement, whereas content creators should tailor their offerings to meet the self-presentation needs of their audience."

ISR,2025,Advancing Next-Generation Multimethod Research in Information Systems: A Framework and Some Recommendations for Authors and Evaluators,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2025.editorial.v36.n2,"The increasing complexity of sociotechnical phenomena, proliferation of diverse data sources, expanding repertoire of research methods, and broadening multiparadigmatic awareness and competence have spurred a growing interest in multimethod research in the information systems (IS) field. This editorial recognizes and celebrates the value of integrating diverse methods and offers a framework to classify multimethod research using two dimensions: (a) methodological distance—the degree of difference (proximate or distant) between methods employed in terms of characteristics such as paradigmatic assumptions, techniques, and goals; and (b) nature of integration—the extent to which the methods are combined in loosely coupled (interlayered) or tightly coupled (intertwined) ways. These dimensions yield four types of multimethod research: assembly (proximate methods with interlayered integration), blend (proximate methods with intertwined integration), bridge (distant methods with interlayered integration), and fusion (distant methods with intertwined integration). We illustrate each archetype with studies published in leading IS journals. Building on these examples, we provide actionable guidance for authors on conducting and presenting multimethod research and also offer recommendations for evaluators of multimethod work. More broadly, we call on the IS community to embrace multimethod research not as an ad hoc stack of methods, but as a systematic strategy, aligning with these recommendations related to methodological distance and nature of integration, to produce a credible, revelatory, and rich body of knowledge on multifaceted IS phenomena."
ISR,2025,Impact of the General Data Protection Regulation on the Global Mobile App Market: Digital Trade Implications of Data Protection and Privacy Regulations,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0421,"Although regional data protection and privacy regimes are often cited as major barriers to crossborder digital trade, mitigating consumer privacy concerns through regulations can potentially increase the demand for foreign digital products or services. This study presents empirical evidence on this issue by examining the impact of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on the global mobile app market. We construct a comprehensive data set of apps distributed by Apple’s App Store over the 26-month period covering the enactment of the GDPR and employ econometric models to analyze the regulation’s effects on app trade between country pairs. Contrary to assertions that regional data protection and privacy regulations impede digital trade and aggravate fragmentation, the empirical results demonstrate a significant increase in top-performing foreign apps compared with native ones in the European Union countries post-GDPR. We further conduct a series of analyses to explore the underlying mechanisms potentially driving these effects from both the supply and demand sides. Our findings lend support to the demand-side mechanism, whereby the GDPR helps alleviate consumer privacy concerns and provides reassurance in adopting foreign digital products."
ISR,2025,The Impact of Geographic and Social Proximity on Physicians: Evidence from the Adoption of an Online Health Community,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2020.0663,"Although online doctor consultations are rapidly gaining popularity, physicians must actively participate in physician–patient interaction platforms to fully unlock their potential. Through a social influence lens, this study empirically investigates physician adoption behavior over time across regions in the diffusion of an online health community (OHC). We examined the impacts of geographically and socially close adopters and investigated the interaction of proximity influences and competition in adoption. We collected panel data on 21,654 physicians in 32 cities in three provinces in China from a large Chinese OHC. The results demonstrate that both geographic and social proximity facilitate adoption when local competition is low. However, as local competition increases, the impact of socially close prior adopters increases, whereas that of geographically close prior adopters decreases. This pattern becomes stronger for physicians with lower titles."
ISR,2025,Deeper Down the Rabbit Hole: How Technology Conspiracy Beliefs Emerge and Foster a Conspiracy Mindset,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0494,"Conspiracy theories, which allege that powerful groups hatch malicious plots, are increasingly recognized as a threat to contemporary society. Although research acknowledges the role of information technology (IT) in spreading such theories, the understanding of conspiracy beliefs related to technology, their formation, and their effects remains limited. Building on theoretical insights on conspiracy beliefs and information systems (IS) research dealing with the impact of individuals’ perceptions of technology, we theorize on technology conspiracy beliefs. We define technology conspiracy beliefs as an individual’s endorsement of an unverified narrative that purports that an organization issuing technology is using that technology to secretly pursue evil goals. We then develop the TECONMIND (technology-conspiracy-mindset) model, which suggests that an individual’s perceptions of a technology’s characteristics (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and perceived risks) and its issuer’s characteristics (perceived malevolence and perceived power) can lead to the formation of technology conspiracy beliefs. Moreover, the model proposes a reciprocal relationship between technology conspiracy beliefs and a broader conspiracy mindset. Accordingly, we expect technology conspiracy beliefs to foster a conspiracy mindset, which in turn, promotes further technology conspiracy beliefs. We provide empirical evidence for the prevalence of technology conspiracy beliefs and then test this model in two studies—a multiwave field study and an experiment—that support our central propositions. Our study contributes to IS research in three ways. First, by developing a conceptual understanding of technology conspiracy beliefs, we introduce an IT artifact-centered concept that allows researchers to explore a previously overlooked dark side of technology. Second, we establish a reciprocal relationship between technology conspiracy beliefs and conspiracy mindsets, indicating that the endorsement of technology conspiracy beliefs can set in motion a vicious cycle in which individuals increasingly interpret their environment using conspiracy theories. Third, we provide an initial understanding of which perceived technology and issuer characteristics make technologies prone to become objects of conspiracy beliefs. Our findings should sensitize technology developers and policymakers as to how their decisions can instigate or mitigate technology conspiracy beliefs, which have significant long-term societal consequences."
ISR,2025,Monitoring and Home Bias in Global Hiring: Evidence from an Online Labor Platform,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0526,"The increasing prevalence of remote work has accelerated the adoption of monitoring systems to keep track of worker behavior, especially on online labor platforms. In contrast to the existing literature that predominantly focuses on the effect of monitoring on productivity, this study investigates the impact of monitoring from the perspective of contractual governance. In principle, by enabling the detailed real-time observation of worker progress, the deployment of monitoring systems has the potential to improve contractual control and coordination, thereby reducing employers’ preferences for domestic workers (home bias). Leveraging the exogenous introduction of a monitoring system for time-based projects on a leading online labor platform, we employ a difference-in-differences model to estimate the impact of monitoring systems in reducing home bias. Our findings reveal that following the monitoring system’s introduction, the bias against foreign workers becomes substantially weaker and statistically insignificant, highlighting the overlooked role of monitoring systems in fostering a more level playing field for global workers. Our further analysis indicates that monitoring leads to a notable 15% increase in the hiring of foreign workers. Moreover, the decrease in home bias is more pronounced in high-routine projects or when employers lack prior positive experiences with foreign workers, two scenarios characterized by low external uncertainty and high internal uncertainty, respectively. Additionally, employers no longer exhibit a stronger home bias when workers have higher ratings, where the expected moral hazard risk is lower, nor when workers reside in the same time zone, where expected coordination costs are lower. These findings lend support to the effectiveness of monitoring systems in mitigating employers’ home bias through enhancing contractual control and coordination. Our findings provide important managerial implications for the design of online labor platforms."
ISR,2025,Learning Personalized Privacy Preference from Public Data,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0318,"Learning consumers’ personalized privacy preferences is crucial for firms and policymakers to establish trust and compliance and guide effective policymaking. Existing approaches rely mostly on private information such as proprietary user behavior data and individual-level demographic and socio-economic factors, or require explicit user input, which can be invasive and burdensome, potentially leading to user dissatisfaction. Nowadays, individuals generate and share vast amounts of information about themselves in the public domain, which can provide a valuable multifaceted view of their behaviors, attitudes, and preferences. This information thus has the potential to provide valuable insights into individuals’ privacy preferences. In this study, we propose a novel framework to predict personalized privacy preference by leveraging a ubiquitous source of public data—social media posts. Deeply rooted in psychological and privacy theories, we use deep learning model and natural language processing algorithms to learn theory-driven psychosocial traits such as lifestyle, risk preference, personality, privacy-related economic preferences, linguistic styles, and more from social media posts. Interestingly, we find that psychosocial traits from public data provide greater predictive power than private information. Furthermore, we conduct multiple interpretability analyses to understand what drives the model’s performance. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of our model and show that our framework can assist platforms and policymakers in forecasting the consequences of privacy policies. Overall, our framework provides managerial implications for enhancing consumer privacy control and trust, optimizing platform data management, and informing policymakers about better data privacy regulations."
ISR,2025,Time to Stop? An Empirical Investigation on the Consequences of Canceling Monetary Incentives on a Digital Platform,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0017,"Digital platforms commonly use monetary incentives to motivate users to perform specific tasks. Extant studies have shown the effects of introducing such monetary rewards on the outcomes of interest (e.g., participation and performance) on public platforms. However, little is known about the impact of canceling rewards (i.e., whether it simply reverses the effect of their introduction), and particularly less attention is paid to corporate platforms. Our study examines the impact of canceling monetary incentives using quasi-natural experiments on a corporate platform. Similar to prior studies focusing on public platforms, we find that introducing quantity-based monetary incentives increases participation (contribution quantity), but has no significant effect on performance (contribution quality). Yet, in contrast, our main empirical analysis reveals that canceling monetary incentives is not simply the reverse process of their introduction. In particular, compared with the increase in participation when monetary rewards were initially introduced, the cancellation of these rewards leads to a sharper decrease in participation. This suggests that canceling rewards has a net negative impact on participation. In addition, canceling monetary rewards also causes a significant decline in performance, which indicates that the effects of canceling and introducing rewards on performance are not simply the opposite of each other. Furthermore, we examine the heterogeneous responses of individuals with different self-motivation types and working competency levels to monetary incentives, highlighting the “asymmetry” between canceling and introducing incentives. We also discuss the similarities and differences between corporate and public platforms regarding the impact of monetary incentives. Our results provide important practical implications for enterprise information systems and general information systems regarding their design of platform strategies."
ISR,2025,Navigating Platform-Led Affiliate Marketing: Implications for Content Creation and Platform Profitability,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0620,"Recently, some user-generated content (UGC) platforms have introduced shopping features to generate additional commission-based revenue from in-app transactions. These platforms allow creators to produce shoppable content, where promoted products are tagged with affiliate links, and in return, they earn a percentage of the commission the creators receive from merchants (such a new business model is referred to asplatform-led affiliate marketing). Despite its growing popularity, the impact of this business model on the key stakeholders (i.e., UGC platforms, content creators, and content consumers) has yet to be systematically analyzed in the existing literature. This paper aims to address this significant literature gap by employing a game-theoretic model. Our findings demonstrate that platform-led affiliate marketing can create a win-win situation for UGC platforms, creators participating in affiliate marketing, and content consumers. Furthermore, we find that even creators not participating in affiliate marketing can sometimes benefit indirectly from other creators’ participation. On the other hand, surprisingly, we find that UGC platforms may not necessarily benefit from adopting this emerging business model because of potential losses in traffic revenue. These results carry significant managerial implications for UGC platforms regarding whether and how to leverage affiliate marketing. Moreover, our findings suggest that creators may benefit from reducing their production efforts in the face of intensified competition. More importantly, optimal production decisions for creators can vary significantly, depending on specific factors (e.g., an increase in the number of creators or content substitutability) contributing to heightened competition. These findings offer valuable insights that can guide creators in refining their production strategies."
ISR,2025,"Mobile Apps, Trading Behaviors, and Portfolio Performance: Evidence from a Quasi-Experiment in China",https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2020.0616,"Mobile apps are among the most important and widely used financial technology (fintech) innovations in the brokerage industry. Surprisingly, despite their increasing economic importance and theoretical significance, few studies examine the effects of mobile app use on individual investors’ financial decisions and performance. This study seeks to understand how mobile apps influence investors’ trading behaviors and portfolio performance by using a proprietary longitudinal data set from December 2012 to November 2015 from a large securities company in China with a quasi-experimental setting to answer our research questions. We leverage the introduction of an app to identify the effect of mobile app adoption by using a sample of 20,665 investors. We use the generalized synthetic control method and find that mobile app adoption does not affect investors’ portfolio performance when one examines aggregate impacts using a binary indicator of mobile app use. Our analyses of the mechanisms indicate that adopting mobile apps results in a noticeable decrease in time constraints, a proxy for transaction friction, and a modest increase intrend-chasing bias, reflecting tendencies toward myopic decision making. Because the reduction in time constraints can benefit investors’ performance, the increase in trend-chasing can be detrimental to investors’ performance; our findings explain why mobile app adoption has no overall effect on portfolio performance. Further analyses of adopters’ postadoption behaviors provide interesting insights and show that the mobile app usage intensity has an inverted U–shaped relationship with portfolio performance. The results are robust to using different samples or excluding high market volatility periods and by using a variety of methods, such as propensity score matching, dynamic matching, stacked difference in differences, or an instrumental variable approach. We discuss the implications for research and practice."
ISR,2025,Clocking in or Not? Optimal Design of a Novel Gamified Business Model in Online Learning,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0138,"Clocking-in cash-back (CIC), an emerging gamified business model in online learning, has recently garnered significant attention. CIC allows users to secure a full refund of the course fee through consecutive completion of specific tasks within a required time window. These tasks, known asclocking in, encompass activities such as daily assignments and sharing progress updates on social media. By employing this gamification system, the firm effectively monitors user efforts, categorizing them as winners or quitters based on clocking-in completion. Despite its growing popularity, this new business model has yet to be systematically analyzed in the literature. This paper fills this critical gap by examining how an online learning firm should set the optimal time window for its course and how the time window is affected by context-specific factors. We identify two opposing effects associated with extending the time window on users’ quitting time: thepsychological-disutility increasingeffect (negative) and theeffort-cost decreasingeffect (positive). Our results indicate that as quitters’ positiveword-of-mouth(WOM) effects increase, there are cases in which the firm should opt for shortening the time window, primarily because of the psychological-disutility increasing effect outweighing the effort-cost decreasing effect. Furthermore, we find that it is not always beneficial for the firm to extend the time window when there is an increased presence of high-ability users. Additionally, we find that as the marginal content creation cost rises, instead of reducing the difficulty level of each task, the firm may find it more advantageous to raise the difficulty level by shortening the time window. Our findings provide valuable insights that online learning firms can utilize to enhance their design of the CIC mechanism."
ISR,2025,HyperCARS: Using Hyperbolic Embeddings for Generating Hierarchical Contextual Situations in Context-Aware Recommender Systems,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0202,"Contextual situations, such as having dinner at a restaurant on Friday with the spouse, became a useful mechanism to represent context in context-aware recommender systems (CARS). Prior research has shown important advantages of using latent embedding representation approaches to model contextual information in the Euclidean space leading to better recommendations. However, these traditional approaches have major challenges with construction of proper embeddings of hierarchical structures of contextual information, as well as with interpretations of the obtained representations that would be useful for managers. To address these problems, we propose the HyperCARS method that models hierarchical contextual situations in the latent hyperbolic space. HyperCARS combines hyperbolic embeddings with hierarchical clustering to construct contextual situations, which allows to loosely couple the contextual modeling component with recommendation algorithms and therefore provides flexibility to use a broad range of previously developed recommendation algorithms. We demonstrate empirically that the proposed hyperbolic embedding approach better captures the hierarchical nature of context than its Euclidean counterpart and produces hierarchical contextual situations that are more distinct and better separated at multiple hierarchical levels. We also demonstrate that hyperbolic contextual situations lead to better context-aware recommendations in terms of standard recommendation metrics and to better interpretability of the resulting hierarchical contextual situations. Because hyperbolic embeddings can also be used in many other applications besides CARS, in this paper, we propose the latent embeddings representation framework that systematically classifies prior work on embeddings and identifies novel research streams for hyperbolic embeddings across information systems applications."
ISR,2025,Stress from Digital Work: Toward a Unified View of Digital Hindrance Stressors,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0691,"There are many models with various sets of hindrance technostressors. Researchers and practitioners face the challenge of selecting a model or mixing several models without guidance on their relative advantages and suitability for contemporary digital work. None of the existing models captures the full conceptual breadth of hindrance technostress, and the existing models typically offer suboptimal power to explain the negative psychological responses or outcomes of technostressors. We synthesize the fragmented works on hindrance technostressors and propose a unified hierarchical model of digital hindrance stressors. We provide an extensive and parsimonious measurement model with high predictive power. This work builds on technostress and occupational stress theory using a quantitative-dominant mixed-methods study. The empirical part of the study includes a qualitative prestudy and multiple surveys with more than 5,800 participants. The data support the modeling, validation, and benchmarking of the new models we introduce. We discuss the relative advantages of the models for research and practice and guide their selection."
ISR,2025,Dynamics of Shared Security in the Cloud,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0256,"Cloud services exist under a shared security environment with a dynamic nature; users trade fixed costs for variable costs over time, and both cloud services providers (CSPs) and users contribute to overall security. We investigate the nature of shared security in a dynamic game where users’ security contributions and cloud usage figure into their CSP’s vulnerability. Furthermore, CSPs’ own security contribution takes into account both their users as well as competition with other CSPs. The Markov perfect equilibrium reveals the long-term time patterns of security of the cloud. In particular, we identify a novel form of time-path strategic complementary between usage and a CSP’s Markov state of security. This implies that cloud security is an unusual form of impure public good, whereby individual contributions bolstering a CSP’s security endow a selective incentive (private benefit) on others rather than on the contributor alone. Because this increases usage, CSP vulnerability increases over time. At the same time, CSP competition on security may lead to both welfare improvements for users and lock-in."
ISR,2025,Beyond Risk: A Measure of Distribution Uncertainty,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0089,"Uncertainty, particularly distribution uncertainty (a.k.a. ambiguity), holds significant relevance in both academic research and practical applications. Much of the existing research, however, has concentrated primarily on addressing outcome uncertainty (or risk), frequently neglecting the aspect of distribution uncertainty. This research delves into distribution uncertainty, a critical yet often overlooked aspect of empirical research. We argue that there is a pressing need to integrate considerations of ambiguity directly into the development and implementation of data analytics models, calling for the promotion and wider use of a well-defined measure of ambiguity. We introduce a quantitative measure of ambiguity that surpasses conventional approaches by precisely capturing distribution uncertainty. We illustrate the properties and advantages of this measure, highlighting its ability to enhance empirical models, yield more reliable parameter estimates, and contribute to the decision-making process. Using decision making in the financial market as an example, we demonstrate the value of this ambiguity measure. This paper promotes a more nuanced understanding of uncertainty and offers implications for both research methodologies and practical risk management."
ISR,2025,Unveiling the Cost of Free: How an Ad-Sponsored Model Affects Serialized Digital Content Creation,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0263,"The selection of a business model significantly impacts the success of digital content platforms, influencing both consumers and creators. Within the field of serialized digital content, establishing incentives that align with creators’ interests poses a notable challenge. Web novel platforms, which allow writers to produce and market their work online, have traditionally adopted a pay-per-view model, where readers pay for access to content. However, a recent trend has seen the introduction of an ad-sponsored model, aimed at attracting readers with free content. Although the ad-sponsored model expands reader accessibility, its effects on writers remain uncertain. Our study investigates the impacts of the ad-sponsored model on writers’ content creation efforts, leveraging a policy change within a leading web novel platform as a natural experiment. Our results indicate a general decrease in writers’ productivity under the ad-sponsored model. To uncover the underlying mechanism, we focus on the role of reader engagement and conduct a mediation analysis. Our results demonstrate that the ad-sponsored model is associated with less reader engagement, which leads to a subsequent decrease in writers’ content creation efforts. Further, we conduct a reader-level analysis and find a significant decline in engagement with writers among those who consume ad-sponsored content, providing additional evidence supporting our main findings. These results substantiate our hypothesis that diminished reader engagement stems from a perception of reduced “sunk costs” associated with free, ad-sponsored content compared with paid books. From a psychological standpoint, the sunk costs inherent in paid content motivate continued reader engagement and interaction with writers, whereas ad-sponsored reading removes such costs, thereby decreasing reader engagement. This study holds profound implications for digital content platforms, underscoring the necessity for platform managers to carefully evaluate the impacts of implementing the ad-sponsored model on both creators and consumers of serialized digital content."
ISR,2025,The Impact of Situational Achievement Goals on Online Learning Behavior: Results from Field Experiments,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0353,"Despite their prevalence, online learning platforms have difficulty sustaining user motivation, resulting in low engagement and poor performance. Addressing this challenge, we study how these platforms can boost learner motivation by fostering an effective learning environment and inducing different situational goals. We conducted a randomized field experiment with behavioral interventions inspired by the achievement goal theory in a massive open online course with more than 2,000 learners from 171 countries. Using various econometric analyses, we estimate the effects of interventions based on three situational achievement goals: learning, performance-prove, and performance-avoidance. In contrast to the traditional (offline) education literature, which finds learning goals to be the most effective and performance goals to be inferior, we demonstrate that performance-prove goals are the most effective in enhancing online engagement and performance. We trace the roots of this finding to the differences in the structure of online and offline environments and the psychological needs of online learners. We uncover the underlying mechanism by empirically examining how situational achievement goals stimulate different achievement emotions necessary to maintain engagement in the learning process. We further find that the effectiveness of each goal depends on learners’ characteristics: prior performance and social activity. Learners with stronger prior performance benefit more from the performance-prove goal, whereas those with moderate performance levels gain from the performance-avoidance goal, and those with lower prior performance are positively influenced by the learning goal. Socially isolated learners respond best to performance goals. Through a second field experiment, we explore the optimal combination of situational goals. We find that combining learning and performance-prove goals leads to the highest learning outcomes. Our study offers theoretical contributions and practical implications for scholars and platform providers on how to effectively leverage situational achievement goals and related achievement emotions for improving online user outcomes."
ISR,2025,Does Virtual Reality Help Property Sales? Empirical Evidence from a Real Estate Platform,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.9138,"Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a transformative addition to real estate platforms, revolutionizing the presentation of property details. In contrast to traditional presentation technologies (e.g., pictures and videos), VR constructs an interactive three-dimensional (3D) environment for consumers to obtain property information. Prior literature mainly examined VR’s effects (e.g., vividness and interactivity) on selling low-involvement products such as books and apparel from a behavioral perspective. Real estate properties are typical high-involvement products, differing significantly in product value, importance, risk, and agent participation, necessitating comprehensive product information. We use a large-scale data set from a leading real estate platform to investigate VR’s influences on properties’ market outcomes (including the time-on-market and selling price) from an informative perspective. We find that VR is an “efficiency enhancer,” accelerating properties’ time-on-market rather than increasing properties’ selling price as a “market value influencer.” VR shows a greater acceleration effect for properties with higher product involvement, higher product quality, and lower agent service quality. This demonstrates VR’s ability in enhancing information richness to satisfy consumers’ information needs for a higher level of product involvement; establishing information credibility in discerning product quality; and serving as an alternative information source in lieu of low-quality agent services. We also disentangle the direct effect of VR Tour from the indirect effect of VR badge on consumers’ decision making to reveal VR’s effectiveness in product evaluation. This work contributes to the literature on nonimmersive VR and offers managerial implications, particularly in the context of property sales, high-involvement product marketing, and product presentation technologies in e-commerce."
ISR,2025,How to Make My Bug Bounty Cost-Effective? A Game-Theoretical Model,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0349,"To mitigate the threats from malicious exploitation of vulnerabilities, an increasing number of organizations across different industries have started incorporating bug bounty programs (BBPs) in their vulnerability management cycles. Whereas a BBP attracts external security researchers to facilitate the discovery of vulnerabilities in organizations’ information technology systems, it also increases the risks after the vulnerabilities are discovered. To deal with the trade-offs, organizations need to understand how to design an optimal bounty and evaluate the total cost of a BBP depending on several key factors. The industry is motivated to understand how the bounty and total costs are impacted by (i) the characteristics of the organization (e.g., security posture and patching complexity), (ii) security researchers (e.g., the heterogeneity among security researchers and their number), and (iii) other factors such as the legal framework surrounding the BBP. However, because there is a lack of formal analyses regarding these issues, we use game-theoretical models to shed light on relevant questions and provide several useful results and managerial insights. First, although an organization’s patching complexity and the bounty act as substitutes, the relationship between security posture and the bounty is not necessarily substitutive or complementary. Furthermore, having a larger number of or more capable security researchers does not necessarily imply an increased bounty or lower total costs. Moreover, whereas the prevalent business belief is that an increased level of legal protection offered to the security researchers increases the cost of the BBP, we find that neither the cost of the BBP nor the offered bounty necessarily increases or decreases. This nuanced finding depends on different types of costs incurred because of the inherent vulnerability itself and costs related to possible leaks out of the BBP. Our study provides insights to security professionals, organizations, and policymakers in designing cost-effective BBPs."
ISR,2025,Does David Make A Goliath? Impact of Rival’s Expertise Signals on Online User Engagement,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0282,"How does information on a rival’s expertise influence the focal user’s engagement in online competitive settings? Online competitive settings differ fundamentally from other online contexts, such as e-commerce and social media platforms, explored in the prior work. This contextual distinction, we argue, is important as it determines the relationship between information about others and the focal user’s engagement. The relevance of this question relates to broader theoretical ambiguities concerning the effects of status and past performance as relative and absolute signals of expertise. Our findings are based on a field experiment in which we modified the multiround mobile two-player gaming app interface, randomly exposing players to rival’s status and past performance signals. We measure the focal user’s engagement regarding their decision to continue the game after each round. As a baseline, we find that the focal user is less likely to continue the game if the rival exhibits higher current performance. However, the rival’s status and past performance signals create strong contingencies wherein the principle effect of current performance is stronger if the rival has a high status or moderate past performance. Further, these contingent effects are partly predicated on the focal player’s motivation to compete. These findings offer several important implications for driving user engagement in online competitive settings and meaningfully advance our current understanding of the effects of status and past performance information on online engagement."
ISR,2025,Platform Governance with Algorithm-Based Content Moderation: An Empirical Study on Reddit,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0036,"With increasing volumes of participation in social media and online communities, content moderation has become an integral component of platform governance. Volunteer (human) moderators have thus far been the essential workforce for content moderation. Because volunteer-based content moderation faces challenges in achieving scalable, desirable, and sustainable moderation, many online platforms have recently started to adopt algorithm-based content moderation tools (bots). When bots are introduced into platform governance, it is unclear how volunteer moderators react in terms of their community-policing and -nurturing efforts. To understand the impacts of these increasingly popular bot moderators, we conduct an empirical study with data collected from 156 communities (subreddits) on Reddit. Based on a series of econometric analyses, we find that bots augment volunteer moderators by stimulating them to moderate a larger quantity of posts, and such effects are pronounced in larger communities. Specifically, volunteer moderators perform 20.9% more community policing, particularly over subjective rules. Moreover, in communities with larger sizes, volunteers also exert increased efforts in offering more explanations and suggestions after their community adopted bots. Notably, increases in activities are primarily driven by the increased need for nurturing efforts to accompany growth in subjective policing. Moreover, introducing bots to content moderation also improves the retention of volunteer moderators. Overall, we show that introducing algorithm-based content moderation into platform governance is beneficial for sustaining digital communities."

We conducted four major experiments to examine users’ perceptions (trustworthiness, affinity, and willingness to work with) and behaviors while using DHA via a mixed-method approach with data from quantitative surveys, qualitative interviews, direct observations, and neurophysiological measurements. Four different DHAs were used in our experiments, which included commercial products from two different vendors (which proved to be immature) and two future-focused ones (where participants were successfully led to believe that the human-controlled digital human was controlled by AI). The first study compared user perceptions of a DHA, a chatbot, and a human agent from a written description and found few differences between the DHA and the chatbot. The second study compared perceptions after using a commercially available DHA and a chatbot. Most participants reported problems using acurrentproduction implementation of DHA, either finding it uncanny or robotic or having trouble conversing with it. The third and fourth studies used a plausiblefuture-focused“Wizard of Oz” design by informing users that the DHA was controlled by AI when it was actually controlled by a human. Participants still preferred a human agent using video conferencing to the DHA, but after controlling for visual fidelity, we did not find evidence of differences between the human and the DHA. Current DHAs that have communication problems trigger greater affinity than chatbots but are otherwise similar to them. When the DHAs’ representation and communication ability match human ability, we failed to find differences between DHAs and human agents for simple customer service tasks. Our results also add to research on algorithm aversion and suggest that the anthropomorphic computer interfaces of DHA might alleviate algorithm aversion."
ISR,2025,Omnificence or Differentiation? An Empirical Study of Knowledge Structure and Career Development of IT Workers,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0634,"Amid the growing importance of information technology (IT) in the business landscape, the pivotal role of IT knowledge on the demand side of the labor market, at both industry and firm levels, is well documented. However, the important labor supply side concerning IT workers has remained largely unknown. This raises challenges about how IT professionals should strategically cultivate their IT knowledge structures toward a sustainable, well-compensated career path. This paper bridges this gap by examining how different types of IT knowledge structures of IT workers impact their salaries and job security over time. We theorize, define, and operationalize two new metrics to characterize the knowledge structures of an IT worker.Knowledge omnificencemeasures the breadth of an IT worker’s own knowledge structure, whereasknowledge differentiationassesses the extent of difference between one’s knowledge set and those of their peers. By analyzing extensive career data of IT workers from 2000 to 2016, we demonstrated that, on average, a high level of IT knowledge differentiation or omnificence yields positive economic returns for IT workers. However, there is an intriguing twist: such a positive relationship is not monotonic. The most advantageous strategy is to acquire IT knowledge at moderate levels of knowledge omnificence and differentiation. Further, our results revealed another new twist: to increase salary potential or pursue a better position, one should aim for knowledge omnificence, whereas those valuing job security should aim for knowledge differentiation. This aligns with our theoretical rationale that utilizes a structured framework, integrating the dynamic capability framework and the boundaryless career theory. Besides, we found that both knowledge omnificence and differentiation reduced gender disparity in the labor market. In particular, females benefited more, with a 14.74% (or 1.38%) increase in salary, from having a one-unit increase in knowledge omnificence (or differentiation). This study holds critical managerial implications for IT workers, firms, and policymakers. It emphasizes the importance of strategic management of IT knowledge structure in enabling IT workers to thrive in the dynamic and competitive IT job market."
ISR,2025,The Effect of Voice AI on Digital Commerce,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0140,"Voice-activated shopping assistants (voice AI), such as Amazon Alexa and Alibaba Tmall Genie, have been gaining popularity worldwide as a new channel for online shopping. In this paper, we analyze large-scale archival data of consumer-level purchase records from Alibaba, the world’s largest e-commerce platform, to empirically investigate how consumers’ adoption of Tmall Genie affects their consumption. The results show that the average consumer’s weekly spending the e-commerce platform increased by 16.6% within the first four months after adopting voice AI. Additionally, we explore specific product features that moderate the effect of Genie adoption by examining repeat purchases, product substitutability, and familiarity, supporting a mechanism that involves reducing information acquisition costs. The positive effects of Genie adoption remain significant on repeat purchases in the long term, although they attenuate over time. Furthermore, our analyses reveal that on average, the voice channel has a positive spillover effect on spending on the PC channel but no significant effect on the mobile channel. The channel dynamics are contingent on specific shopping contexts. Our results demonstrate that voice AI devices with shopping capabilities can enhance the growth of the affiliated e-commerce platform. As the first study to empirically examine the impact of voice AI adoption on e-commerce consumption, our paper provides valuable implications for e-commerce platforms and retailers leveraging voice-activated shopping."
ISR,2025,The Effect of Popularity Cues and Peer Endorsements on Assertive Social Media Ads,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0606,"Social media platforms, such as Facebook, often display assertive call-to- action ads that encourage direct conversion actions, such as purchasing a product or installing an app. Additionally, these ads can display popularity signals (i.e., “likes”) and social endorsement from friends (i.e., friends’ “likes”). We examine the effectiveness of displaying these different signals on such ads in generating clicks through field tests conducted on Facebook. We collaborated with a mobile app company and conducted a call-to-action ad campaign on Facebook, targeting unique user groups with this type of ads for a mobile app. Our findings reveal that the overall number of “likes” associated with the ad does not impact the user’s decision to click the ad. Additionally, ads endorsed by friends have a lower clicking performance compared with those without such endorsement. Further analyses based on randomized laboratory studies and additional field tests using different products and apps confirm these results and demonstrate that the presence of these cues activates users’ persuasion knowledge of assertive call-to-action ads, resulting in a lower click performance. Furthermore, the negative impact of social cues is particularly pronounced when there is low similarity between users and their friends. These results have significant implications for the design of assertive call-to-action ads on social media platforms."
ISR,2025,Promoting Security Behaviors in Remote Work Environments: Personal Values Shaping Information Security Policy Compliance,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0563,"Cybersecurity threats and information security policy (ISP) compliance are critical concerns for organizations. The recent trend of working from home has made individual characteristics more relevant in fostering ISP compliance. Whereas extant research has theorized and offered alternatives to induce ISP compliance, most studies have failed to consider the differences between onsite and remote workers to motivate compliance with ISPs and have instead focused on standard interventions without considering personal characteristics. One of the few models including factors related to individuals’ characteristics is the unified model of information security policy compliance (UMISPC). This paper extends the UMISPC by drawing on Schwartz’s universal theory of personal values. We propose the values construct as a robust representation of an individual’s motivations to comply with an ISP. We confirm that personal values are significant predictors of compliance with ISPs. Furthermore, a comparison between onsite and remote workers suggests that personal values are more relevant in remote work settings. Our findings shed light on the values and individual characteristics that are important motivators for ISP compliance and how they differ for onsite and remote workers. Our results suggest that people’s personal motivations should be considered in promoting organizations’ ISPs and that organizations’ interventions should be tailored by understanding what values motivate or hinder ISP compliance."
ISR,2025,Understanding the Dynamic and Episodic Nature of Technostressors and Their Effects on Cyberdeviance: A Daily Field Investigation,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2020.0273,"Technostress is an emerging topic in the information systems (IS) literature. Prior studies have mostly adopted a static approach to capturing snapshots of technostressors, without considering their dynamic and episodic nature. Daily technostress is often the product of discrete events encountered in the workplace that shape employees’ momentary affect and behaviors in situ. To lay the conceptual foundation for understanding deviant behaviors, this study integrates the self-regulation perspective into the transactional model of stress and conducts a contextualized, longitudinal, and daily investigation of how and when daily perceived technostressors affect employees’ daily cyberdeviant behaviors (i.e., cyberdeviance). In a time-lagged experience sampling study of 188 professionals who completed a survey three times a day for two weeks, we found that employees experiencing daily techno-overload and techno-invasion are likely to engage in daily cyberdeviance to cope with their daily exhaustion. We also examined the cross-level moderating effect of an individual trait (i.e., technology self-efficacy) on the strength of the within-person process model of daily cyberdeviance. Our multilevel analysis results showed that technology self-efficacy alleviated employees’ daily exhaustion induced by daily techno-overload. This study theoretically contributes to the IS literature by providing a theoretical explanation of the underlying mechanisms of techno-overload, techno-invasion, and employees’ cyberdeviance, in addition to using a within-person approach to understand the dynamic and episodic nature of these technostressors."

The rise of performance-based advertising, in which advertising is paid based on consumer actions, such as clicking on or purchasing through an ad link, presents challenges in measuring the effectiveness of advertising. Specifically, it becomes difficult to differentiate whether a consumer’s action is caused by ad-signal or the inherent product appeal. This leads to a critical question: how does this inaccuracy in evaluating advertising effectiveness affect the signaling role of advertising? This research analyzes how the inherent product reputation and the breadth of ad-signal reach impact the signaling role of advertising, uncovering two paradoxes under performance-based advertising: a higher product reputation does not necessarily help advertising to signal product quality (product reputation paradox), and a broader ad-signal reach can impede the signaling role of advertising (ad-signal reach paradox). We propose modified payment schemes to address both paradoxes. These insights contribute to advertising signaling theory and offer practical guidance for designing effective payment schemes under performance-based advertising."
ISR,2025,Opening First-Party App Resources: Empirical Evidence of Free-Riding,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0607,"Platform owners are releasing their own apps on their platforms. These first-party apps (FPAs) typically leverage platform resources more effectively, competitively threatening rivals. Although the impact of FPAs on rivals’ innovation has been the subject of extensive study, the dominant view in previous research assumes that these FPAs are closed to third-party apps (TPAs). However, there is an increasing trend of FPAs opening their resources to TPAs, as they provide application programming interfaces (APIs) allowing TPAs to access their resources. Rivals still exist, as many TPAs choose not to have access to FPAs’ open resources because of their limited control over these resources. Does opening an FPA’s resources impact rivals’ innovation? The answer to the question is largely unknown. We exploit the release of the Apple Health Records API, a feature that opens Apple Health Records to TPAs, to design a quasi-experiment that investigates whether and how opening an FPA’s resources influence rivals’ innovations. Through several analyses, we conclude that opening an FPA’s resources to TPAs generates free-riding benefits for rivals. Moreover, these benefits mainly arise because of the growing presence of TPAs that do not adopt FPAs’ open resources in the market. We discuss the theoretical contributions and practical implications of our findings."
ISR,2025,"Timely Quality Problem Resolution in Peer-Production Systems: The Impact of Bots, Policy Citations, and Contributor Experience",https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2020.0485,"Although online peer-production systems have proven to be effective in producing high-quality content, their open call for participation makes them susceptible to ongoing quality problems. A key concern is that the problems should be addressed quickly to prevent low-quality content from remaining in place for extended periods. We examine the impacts of two control mechanisms, bots and policy citations, and the number of contributors, with and without prior experience in editing an article, on the cleanup time of 4,473 quality problem events in Wikipedia. We definecleanup timeas the time it takes to resolve a quality problem once it has been detected in an article. Using an accelerated failure time model, we find that the number of bots editing an article during a quality problem event has no effect on cleanup time; that citing policies to justify edits during the event is associated with a longer cleanup time; and that more contributors, with or without prior experience in editing the article, are associated with a shorter cleanup time. We also find important interactions between each of the two control mechanisms and the number of different types of contributors. There is a marginal increase in cleanup time that is larger when an increase in the number of contributors is accompanied by fewer bots editing the article during a quality problem event. This interaction effect is more pronounced when increasing the number of contributors without prior experience in editing the article. Further, there is a marginal decrease in cleanup time that is larger when an increase in the number of contributors, with or without prior experience in editing the article, is accompanied by fewer policy citations. Taken together, our results show that the use of bots and policy citations as control mechanisms must be considered in conjunction with the number of contributors with and without prior experience in editing an article. Accordingly, the number of contributors and their experience alone may not explain important outcomes in peer production; it is also important to find an appropriate mix of different control mechanisms and types of contributors to address quality problems quickly."
