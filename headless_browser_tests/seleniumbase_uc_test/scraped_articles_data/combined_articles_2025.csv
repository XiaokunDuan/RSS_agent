ISR,2025,Follow Your Heart or Listen to Users? The Case of Mobile App Design,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0060,"Firms strive to improve their products over time to compete effectively in the market. Typically, firms update their products by adding novel or differentiating features or by imitating competitors. With the ubiquity of social media, there is also the opportunity to obtain customer input on their preferred features for a product. In the case of mobile apps, user feedback in the form of reviews may include suggestions of novel features or those that are already present in competing apps but not in the focal app. Leveraging the information contained in reviews and version release notes of iOS apps, we develop a deep learning–based natural language processing approach to identify four types of app features: developer-initiated novel, developer-initiated imitative, user-suggested novel, and user-suggested imitative. We evaluate the impact of these feature categories on app demand. Our results demonstrate that only developer-initiated novel and user-suggested imitative features help increase app demand. We also find that the impact of user-suggested novel features is negative. However, this negative effect is limited to features that are contextually distant from user suggestions, whereas contextually close implementations have a positive effect. Although we observe that the aggregate impact of developer-initiated imitative features is statistically insignificant, features that are slightly modified from the original apps do have a positive effect on demand. The primary contribution of our study is to investigate user reviews as a source of ideas for new features and to evaluate their performance impacts relative to those of developer-initiated features."
ISR,2025,Customer Engagement Prediction on Social Media: A Graph Neural Network Method,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0281,"With the rapid prevalence and massive user growth of social media platforms, efficiently targeting potential customers on these platforms has grown in importance for companies. Enhancing the likelihood that a social media user will engage with brand posts holds profound implications for online marketing strategy design. However, predicting customer engagement on social media comes with its own set of challenges. In this work, we design a graph neural network model called the graph neural network with attention mechanism for customer engagement (GACE) to predict customer engagement (like/comment/share) of brand posts. We exploit large-scale content consumption information from the perspective of heterogeneous networks and learn latent customer representation by developing a graph neural network model. We examine GACE using a large-scale Facebook data set, and the comprehensive results show significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we conduct an interpretability analysis, which sheds some light on the explanation of the proposed model. To illustrate the practical significance of our work, we provide examples to quantify the economic value of improved predictive power using a cost-revenue analysis in the context of targeted marketing."
ISR,2025,Flow of the Game: A Hidden Markov Model of Player Engagement in Online Mobile Games,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0217,"With the rapid development of mobile technology and consumers’ increasing demand for portability, the mobile gaming market has experienced huge growth. To ensure the success of mobile games, game publishers need to keep their players engaged and, at the same time, seek monetization strategies that do not interrupt players’ engagement. This paper examines how in-game challenge-related factors (i.e., perceived challenge and fluctuation of perceived challenge) and a novel mobile game monetization strategy—reward ads—affect players’ engagement. Reward ads, a popular in-app advertising monetization model in which players can voluntarily watch an ad in exchange for a reward within the game, can help publishers generate revenue without breaking the flow of the game. We develop a Hidden Markov Model and employ detailed tap-stream data from a mobile game app to study how challenge-related factors and reward ads affect players’ dynamic engagement state evolution. First, we find that players’ perceived challenge level has a positive, but diminishing, marginal effect on players’ engagement state transitions. Second, a higher fluctuation of perceived challenge increases the probability that players move to a higher engagement state. Third, the scaffolding earned by watching reward ads can help players transition to a higher engagement level. Furthermore, we study the moderating effect of perceived challenge on reward ads, and we find that reward ads are more helpful in engaging players when the perceived challenge is higher. The findings enhance the understanding of players’ engagement with mobile games and provide design guidance for mobile game publishers."
ISR,2025,The Impact of Mobile Data Cost on Consumer Price Sensitivity: A Study of a Hotel Booking App,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0450,"The rapid advancement of mobile internet technologies, such as 4G and 5 G, has greatly enhanced the accessibility and convenience of mobile shopping. However, along with these benefits, mobile data usage has introduced a novel form of search cost in consumers’ purchasing decisions compared with Wi-Fi. This arises from the perception that mobile data are more costly because of additional charges incurred when exceeding the fixed data quota, which contributes to the increase of mental cost during the search process. To examine the influence of mobile data cost on consumer price sensitivity, we conduct empirical research utilizing hotel search data obtained from a prominent hotel booking app. Our findings reveal that consumers exhibit approximately twice the level of price sensitivity when utilizing mobile data instead of Wi-Fi, resulting in an average US$17 less in revenue per hotel booking. To assess the causal relations between mobile data cost and consumer price sensitivity, we utilize an approach similar to difference-in-differences and observe that this impact is more pronounced when consumers book hotels at the end of the month (versus the beginning of the month). We further find that consumer search effort decreases when using mobile data (versus Wi-Fi) across decision stages of the search process, supporting the mechanism that mobile data cost drives consumers into the satisficing rather than maximizing search mode. Our research offers practical implications for businesses operating in mobile shopping environments and contributes to policy development in this field."
ISR,2025,From Anonymity to Accountability: How Virtual Identity Disclosure Changes the Quantity and Quality of “Likes”,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2020.0335,"An integral component of user participation in community-based platforms is giving “likes” to content posted by others. At the same time, online social participation differs from offline social participation in that online users are often allowed to create a virtual identity unrelated to their real-world identity. The objective of this study is to identify the motivations behind users’ giving “likes” when their virtual identity (i.e., username) is hidden or shown. Specifically, we leverage a natural experiment to examine the effect of virtual identity disclosure on users’ “liking” behavior. Our identification strategy relies on an exogenous policy change in an online community-based platform, where likers’ username was not visible before but publicly shown after the change. Our results show that users “liked” fewer but higher-quality articles after the policy change, consistent with their protective self-presentation motivation. This study emphasizes the significance of virtual identity, arguing that a virtual identity devoid of real-world information should not be equated with anonymity. It also underscores the importance of protective self-presentation over acquisitive self-presentation, suggesting that research should focus not only on the actions users take but also on those they intentionally avoid taking. Furthermore, our study identifies “liking” as a key channel of self-presentation, complementing the focus on posting behaviors in the extant literature. Practically, platforms can refine their policies on virtual identity disclosure to enhance content engagement, whereas content creators should tailor their offerings to meet the self-presentation needs of their audience."
ISR,2025,Impact of the General Data Protection Regulation on the Global Mobile App Market: Digital Trade Implications of Data Protection and Privacy Regulations,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0421,"Although regional data protection and privacy regimes are often cited as major barriers to crossborder digital trade, mitigating consumer privacy concerns through regulations can potentially increase the demand for foreign digital products or services. This study presents empirical evidence on this issue by examining the impact of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on the global mobile app market. We construct a comprehensive data set of apps distributed by Apple’s App Store over the 26-month period covering the enactment of the GDPR and employ econometric models to analyze the regulation’s effects on app trade between country pairs. Contrary to assertions that regional data protection and privacy regulations impede digital trade and aggravate fragmentation, the empirical results demonstrate a significant increase in top-performing foreign apps compared with native ones in the European Union countries post-GDPR. We further conduct a series of analyses to explore the underlying mechanisms potentially driving these effects from both the supply and demand sides. Our findings lend support to the demand-side mechanism, whereby the GDPR helps alleviate consumer privacy concerns and provides reassurance in adopting foreign digital products."
ISR,2025,The Impact of Geographic and Social Proximity on Physicians: Evidence from the Adoption of an Online Health Community,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2020.0663,"Although online doctor consultations are rapidly gaining popularity, physicians must actively participate in physician–patient interaction platforms to fully unlock their potential. Through a social influence lens, this study empirically investigates physician adoption behavior over time across regions in the diffusion of an online health community (OHC). We examined the impacts of geographically and socially close adopters and investigated the interaction of proximity influences and competition in adoption. We collected panel data on 21,654 physicians in 32 cities in three provinces in China from a large Chinese OHC. The results demonstrate that both geographic and social proximity facilitate adoption when local competition is low. However, as local competition increases, the impact of socially close prior adopters increases, whereas that of geographically close prior adopters decreases. This pattern becomes stronger for physicians with lower titles."
ISR,2025,Deeper Down the Rabbit Hole: How Technology Conspiracy Beliefs Emerge and Foster a Conspiracy Mindset,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0494,"Conspiracy theories, which allege that powerful groups hatch malicious plots, are increasingly recognized as a threat to contemporary society. Although research acknowledges the role of information technology (IT) in spreading such theories, the understanding of conspiracy beliefs related to technology, their formation, and their effects remains limited. Building on theoretical insights on conspiracy beliefs and information systems (IS) research dealing with the impact of individuals’ perceptions of technology, we theorize on technology conspiracy beliefs. We define technology conspiracy beliefs as an individual’s endorsement of an unverified narrative that purports that an organization issuing technology is using that technology to secretly pursue evil goals. We then develop the TECONMIND (technology-conspiracy-mindset) model, which suggests that an individual’s perceptions of a technology’s characteristics (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and perceived risks) and its issuer’s characteristics (perceived malevolence and perceived power) can lead to the formation of technology conspiracy beliefs. Moreover, the model proposes a reciprocal relationship between technology conspiracy beliefs and a broader conspiracy mindset. Accordingly, we expect technology conspiracy beliefs to foster a conspiracy mindset, which in turn, promotes further technology conspiracy beliefs. We provide empirical evidence for the prevalence of technology conspiracy beliefs and then test this model in two studies—a multiwave field study and an experiment—that support our central propositions. Our study contributes to IS research in three ways. First, by developing a conceptual understanding of technology conspiracy beliefs, we introduce an IT artifact-centered concept that allows researchers to explore a previously overlooked dark side of technology. Second, we establish a reciprocal relationship between technology conspiracy beliefs and conspiracy mindsets, indicating that the endorsement of technology conspiracy beliefs can set in motion a vicious cycle in which individuals increasingly interpret their environment using conspiracy theories. Third, we provide an initial understanding of which perceived technology and issuer characteristics make technologies prone to become objects of conspiracy beliefs. Our findings should sensitize technology developers and policymakers as to how their decisions can instigate or mitigate technology conspiracy beliefs, which have significant long-term societal consequences."
ISR,2025,Monitoring and Home Bias in Global Hiring: Evidence from an Online Labor Platform,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0526,"The increasing prevalence of remote work has accelerated the adoption of monitoring systems to keep track of worker behavior, especially on online labor platforms. In contrast to the existing literature that predominantly focuses on the effect of monitoring on productivity, this study investigates the impact of monitoring from the perspective of contractual governance. In principle, by enabling the detailed real-time observation of worker progress, the deployment of monitoring systems has the potential to improve contractual control and coordination, thereby reducing employers’ preferences for domestic workers (home bias). Leveraging the exogenous introduction of a monitoring system for time-based projects on a leading online labor platform, we employ a difference-in-differences model to estimate the impact of monitoring systems in reducing home bias. Our findings reveal that following the monitoring system’s introduction, the bias against foreign workers becomes substantially weaker and statistically insignificant, highlighting the overlooked role of monitoring systems in fostering a more level playing field for global workers. Our further analysis indicates that monitoring leads to a notable 15% increase in the hiring of foreign workers. Moreover, the decrease in home bias is more pronounced in high-routine projects or when employers lack prior positive experiences with foreign workers, two scenarios characterized by low external uncertainty and high internal uncertainty, respectively. Additionally, employers no longer exhibit a stronger home bias when workers have higher ratings, where the expected moral hazard risk is lower, nor when workers reside in the same time zone, where expected coordination costs are lower. These findings lend support to the effectiveness of monitoring systems in mitigating employers’ home bias through enhancing contractual control and coordination. Our findings provide important managerial implications for the design of online labor platforms."
ISR,2025,Learning Personalized Privacy Preference from Public Data,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0318,"Learning consumers’ personalized privacy preferences is crucial for firms and policymakers to establish trust and compliance and guide effective policymaking. Existing approaches rely mostly on private information such as proprietary user behavior data and individual-level demographic and socio-economic factors, or require explicit user input, which can be invasive and burdensome, potentially leading to user dissatisfaction. Nowadays, individuals generate and share vast amounts of information about themselves in the public domain, which can provide a valuable multifaceted view of their behaviors, attitudes, and preferences. This information thus has the potential to provide valuable insights into individuals’ privacy preferences. In this study, we propose a novel framework to predict personalized privacy preference by leveraging a ubiquitous source of public data—social media posts. Deeply rooted in psychological and privacy theories, we use deep learning model and natural language processing algorithms to learn theory-driven psychosocial traits such as lifestyle, risk preference, personality, privacy-related economic preferences, linguistic styles, and more from social media posts. Interestingly, we find that psychosocial traits from public data provide greater predictive power than private information. Furthermore, we conduct multiple interpretability analyses to understand what drives the model’s performance. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of our model and show that our framework can assist platforms and policymakers in forecasting the consequences of privacy policies. Overall, our framework provides managerial implications for enhancing consumer privacy control and trust, optimizing platform data management, and informing policymakers about better data privacy regulations."
ISR,2025,Time to Stop? An Empirical Investigation on the Consequences of Canceling Monetary Incentives on a Digital Platform,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0017,"Digital platforms commonly use monetary incentives to motivate users to perform specific tasks. Extant studies have shown the effects of introducing such monetary rewards on the outcomes of interest (e.g., participation and performance) on public platforms. However, little is known about the impact of canceling rewards (i.e., whether it simply reverses the effect of their introduction), and particularly less attention is paid to corporate platforms. Our study examines the impact of canceling monetary incentives using quasi-natural experiments on a corporate platform. Similar to prior studies focusing on public platforms, we find that introducing quantity-based monetary incentives increases participation (contribution quantity), but has no significant effect on performance (contribution quality). Yet, in contrast, our main empirical analysis reveals that canceling monetary incentives is not simply the reverse process of their introduction. In particular, compared with the increase in participation when monetary rewards were initially introduced, the cancellation of these rewards leads to a sharper decrease in participation. This suggests that canceling rewards has a net negative impact on participation. In addition, canceling monetary rewards also causes a significant decline in performance, which indicates that the effects of canceling and introducing rewards on performance are not simply the opposite of each other. Furthermore, we examine the heterogeneous responses of individuals with different self-motivation types and working competency levels to monetary incentives, highlighting the “asymmetry” between canceling and introducing incentives. We also discuss the similarities and differences between corporate and public platforms regarding the impact of monetary incentives. Our results provide important practical implications for enterprise information systems and general information systems regarding their design of platform strategies."
ISR,2025,Navigating Platform-Led Affiliate Marketing: Implications for Content Creation and Platform Profitability,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0620,"Recently, some user-generated content (UGC) platforms have introduced shopping features to generate additional commission-based revenue from in-app transactions. These platforms allow creators to produce shoppable content, where promoted products are tagged with affiliate links, and in return, they earn a percentage of the commission the creators receive from merchants (such a new business model is referred to asplatform-led affiliate marketing). Despite its growing popularity, the impact of this business model on the key stakeholders (i.e., UGC platforms, content creators, and content consumers) has yet to be systematically analyzed in the existing literature. This paper aims to address this significant literature gap by employing a game-theoretic model. Our findings demonstrate that platform-led affiliate marketing can create a win-win situation for UGC platforms, creators participating in affiliate marketing, and content consumers. Furthermore, we find that even creators not participating in affiliate marketing can sometimes benefit indirectly from other creators’ participation. On the other hand, surprisingly, we find that UGC platforms may not necessarily benefit from adopting this emerging business model because of potential losses in traffic revenue. These results carry significant managerial implications for UGC platforms regarding whether and how to leverage affiliate marketing. Moreover, our findings suggest that creators may benefit from reducing their production efforts in the face of intensified competition. More importantly, optimal production decisions for creators can vary significantly, depending on specific factors (e.g., an increase in the number of creators or content substitutability) contributing to heightened competition. These findings offer valuable insights that can guide creators in refining their production strategies."
ISR,2025,"Mobile Apps, Trading Behaviors, and Portfolio Performance: Evidence from a Quasi-Experiment in China",https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2020.0616,"Mobile apps are among the most important and widely used financial technology (fintech) innovations in the brokerage industry. Surprisingly, despite their increasing economic importance and theoretical significance, few studies examine the effects of mobile app use on individual investors’ financial decisions and performance. This study seeks to understand how mobile apps influence investors’ trading behaviors and portfolio performance by using a proprietary longitudinal data set from December 2012 to November 2015 from a large securities company in China with a quasi-experimental setting to answer our research questions. We leverage the introduction of an app to identify the effect of mobile app adoption by using a sample of 20,665 investors. We use the generalized synthetic control method and find that mobile app adoption does not affect investors’ portfolio performance when one examines aggregate impacts using a binary indicator of mobile app use. Our analyses of the mechanisms indicate that adopting mobile apps results in a noticeable decrease in time constraints, a proxy for transaction friction, and a modest increase intrend-chasing bias, reflecting tendencies toward myopic decision making. Because the reduction in time constraints can benefit investors’ performance, the increase in trend-chasing can be detrimental to investors’ performance; our findings explain why mobile app adoption has no overall effect on portfolio performance. Further analyses of adopters’ postadoption behaviors provide interesting insights and show that the mobile app usage intensity has an inverted U–shaped relationship with portfolio performance. The results are robust to using different samples or excluding high market volatility periods and by using a variety of methods, such as propensity score matching, dynamic matching, stacked difference in differences, or an instrumental variable approach. We discuss the implications for research and practice."
ISR,2025,Clocking in or Not? Optimal Design of a Novel Gamified Business Model in Online Learning,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0138,"Clocking-in cash-back (CIC), an emerging gamified business model in online learning, has recently garnered significant attention. CIC allows users to secure a full refund of the course fee through consecutive completion of specific tasks within a required time window. These tasks, known asclocking in, encompass activities such as daily assignments and sharing progress updates on social media. By employing this gamification system, the firm effectively monitors user efforts, categorizing them as winners or quitters based on clocking-in completion. Despite its growing popularity, this new business model has yet to be systematically analyzed in the literature. This paper fills this critical gap by examining how an online learning firm should set the optimal time window for its course and how the time window is affected by context-specific factors. We identify two opposing effects associated with extending the time window on users’ quitting time: thepsychological-disutility increasingeffect (negative) and theeffort-cost decreasingeffect (positive). Our results indicate that as quitters’ positiveword-of-mouth(WOM) effects increase, there are cases in which the firm should opt for shortening the time window, primarily because of the psychological-disutility increasing effect outweighing the effort-cost decreasing effect. Furthermore, we find that it is not always beneficial for the firm to extend the time window when there is an increased presence of high-ability users. Additionally, we find that as the marginal content creation cost rises, instead of reducing the difficulty level of each task, the firm may find it more advantageous to raise the difficulty level by shortening the time window. Our findings provide valuable insights that online learning firms can utilize to enhance their design of the CIC mechanism."
ISR,2025,HyperCARS: Using Hyperbolic Embeddings for Generating Hierarchical Contextual Situations in Context-Aware Recommender Systems,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0202,"Contextual situations, such as having dinner at a restaurant on Friday with the spouse, became a useful mechanism to represent context in context-aware recommender systems (CARS). Prior research has shown important advantages of using latent embedding representation approaches to model contextual information in the Euclidean space leading to better recommendations. However, these traditional approaches have major challenges with construction of proper embeddings of hierarchical structures of contextual information, as well as with interpretations of the obtained representations that would be useful for managers. To address these problems, we propose the HyperCARS method that models hierarchical contextual situations in the latent hyperbolic space. HyperCARS combines hyperbolic embeddings with hierarchical clustering to construct contextual situations, which allows to loosely couple the contextual modeling component with recommendation algorithms and therefore provides flexibility to use a broad range of previously developed recommendation algorithms. We demonstrate empirically that the proposed hyperbolic embedding approach better captures the hierarchical nature of context than its Euclidean counterpart and produces hierarchical contextual situations that are more distinct and better separated at multiple hierarchical levels. We also demonstrate that hyperbolic contextual situations lead to better context-aware recommendations in terms of standard recommendation metrics and to better interpretability of the resulting hierarchical contextual situations. Because hyperbolic embeddings can also be used in many other applications besides CARS, in this paper, we propose the latent embeddings representation framework that systematically classifies prior work on embeddings and identifies novel research streams for hyperbolic embeddings across information systems applications."
ISR,2025,Stress from Digital Work: Toward a Unified View of Digital Hindrance Stressors,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0691,"There are many models with various sets of hindrance technostressors. Researchers and practitioners face the challenge of selecting a model or mixing several models without guidance on their relative advantages and suitability for contemporary digital work. None of the existing models captures the full conceptual breadth of hindrance technostress, and the existing models typically offer suboptimal power to explain the negative psychological responses or outcomes of technostressors. We synthesize the fragmented works on hindrance technostressors and propose a unified hierarchical model of digital hindrance stressors. We provide an extensive and parsimonious measurement model with high predictive power. This work builds on technostress and occupational stress theory using a quantitative-dominant mixed-methods study. The empirical part of the study includes a qualitative prestudy and multiple surveys with more than 5,800 participants. The data support the modeling, validation, and benchmarking of the new models we introduce. We discuss the relative advantages of the models for research and practice and guide their selection."
ISR,2025,Dynamics of Shared Security in the Cloud,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0256,"Cloud services exist under a shared security environment with a dynamic nature; users trade fixed costs for variable costs over time, and both cloud services providers (CSPs) and users contribute to overall security. We investigate the nature of shared security in a dynamic game where users’ security contributions and cloud usage figure into their CSP’s vulnerability. Furthermore, CSPs’ own security contribution takes into account both their users as well as competition with other CSPs. The Markov perfect equilibrium reveals the long-term time patterns of security of the cloud. In particular, we identify a novel form of time-path strategic complementary between usage and a CSP’s Markov state of security. This implies that cloud security is an unusual form of impure public good, whereby individual contributions bolstering a CSP’s security endow a selective incentive (private benefit) on others rather than on the contributor alone. Because this increases usage, CSP vulnerability increases over time. At the same time, CSP competition on security may lead to both welfare improvements for users and lock-in."
ISR,2025,Beyond Risk: A Measure of Distribution Uncertainty,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0089,"Uncertainty, particularly distribution uncertainty (a.k.a. ambiguity), holds significant relevance in both academic research and practical applications. Much of the existing research, however, has concentrated primarily on addressing outcome uncertainty (or risk), frequently neglecting the aspect of distribution uncertainty. This research delves into distribution uncertainty, a critical yet often overlooked aspect of empirical research. We argue that there is a pressing need to integrate considerations of ambiguity directly into the development and implementation of data analytics models, calling for the promotion and wider use of a well-defined measure of ambiguity. We introduce a quantitative measure of ambiguity that surpasses conventional approaches by precisely capturing distribution uncertainty. We illustrate the properties and advantages of this measure, highlighting its ability to enhance empirical models, yield more reliable parameter estimates, and contribute to the decision-making process. Using decision making in the financial market as an example, we demonstrate the value of this ambiguity measure. This paper promotes a more nuanced understanding of uncertainty and offers implications for both research methodologies and practical risk management."
ISR,2025,Unveiling the Cost of Free: How an Ad-Sponsored Model Affects Serialized Digital Content Creation,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0263,"The selection of a business model significantly impacts the success of digital content platforms, influencing both consumers and creators. Within the field of serialized digital content, establishing incentives that align with creators’ interests poses a notable challenge. Web novel platforms, which allow writers to produce and market their work online, have traditionally adopted a pay-per-view model, where readers pay for access to content. However, a recent trend has seen the introduction of an ad-sponsored model, aimed at attracting readers with free content. Although the ad-sponsored model expands reader accessibility, its effects on writers remain uncertain. Our study investigates the impacts of the ad-sponsored model on writers’ content creation efforts, leveraging a policy change within a leading web novel platform as a natural experiment. Our results indicate a general decrease in writers’ productivity under the ad-sponsored model. To uncover the underlying mechanism, we focus on the role of reader engagement and conduct a mediation analysis. Our results demonstrate that the ad-sponsored model is associated with less reader engagement, which leads to a subsequent decrease in writers’ content creation efforts. Further, we conduct a reader-level analysis and find a significant decline in engagement with writers among those who consume ad-sponsored content, providing additional evidence supporting our main findings. These results substantiate our hypothesis that diminished reader engagement stems from a perception of reduced “sunk costs” associated with free, ad-sponsored content compared with paid books. From a psychological standpoint, the sunk costs inherent in paid content motivate continued reader engagement and interaction with writers, whereas ad-sponsored reading removes such costs, thereby decreasing reader engagement. This study holds profound implications for digital content platforms, underscoring the necessity for platform managers to carefully evaluate the impacts of implementing the ad-sponsored model on both creators and consumers of serialized digital content."
ISR,2025,The Impact of Situational Achievement Goals on Online Learning Behavior: Results from Field Experiments,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0353,"Despite their prevalence, online learning platforms have difficulty sustaining user motivation, resulting in low engagement and poor performance. Addressing this challenge, we study how these platforms can boost learner motivation by fostering an effective learning environment and inducing different situational goals. We conducted a randomized field experiment with behavioral interventions inspired by the achievement goal theory in a massive open online course with more than 2,000 learners from 171 countries. Using various econometric analyses, we estimate the effects of interventions based on three situational achievement goals: learning, performance-prove, and performance-avoidance. In contrast to the traditional (offline) education literature, which finds learning goals to be the most effective and performance goals to be inferior, we demonstrate that performance-prove goals are the most effective in enhancing online engagement and performance. We trace the roots of this finding to the differences in the structure of online and offline environments and the psychological needs of online learners. We uncover the underlying mechanism by empirically examining how situational achievement goals stimulate different achievement emotions necessary to maintain engagement in the learning process. We further find that the effectiveness of each goal depends on learners’ characteristics: prior performance and social activity. Learners with stronger prior performance benefit more from the performance-prove goal, whereas those with moderate performance levels gain from the performance-avoidance goal, and those with lower prior performance are positively influenced by the learning goal. Socially isolated learners respond best to performance goals. Through a second field experiment, we explore the optimal combination of situational goals. We find that combining learning and performance-prove goals leads to the highest learning outcomes. Our study offers theoretical contributions and practical implications for scholars and platform providers on how to effectively leverage situational achievement goals and related achievement emotions for improving online user outcomes."
ISR,2025,Does Virtual Reality Help Property Sales? Empirical Evidence from a Real Estate Platform,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.9138,"Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a transformative addition to real estate platforms, revolutionizing the presentation of property details. In contrast to traditional presentation technologies (e.g., pictures and videos), VR constructs an interactive three-dimensional (3D) environment for consumers to obtain property information. Prior literature mainly examined VR’s effects (e.g., vividness and interactivity) on selling low-involvement products such as books and apparel from a behavioral perspective. Real estate properties are typical high-involvement products, differing significantly in product value, importance, risk, and agent participation, necessitating comprehensive product information. We use a large-scale data set from a leading real estate platform to investigate VR’s influences on properties’ market outcomes (including the time-on-market and selling price) from an informative perspective. We find that VR is an “efficiency enhancer,” accelerating properties’ time-on-market rather than increasing properties’ selling price as a “market value influencer.” VR shows a greater acceleration effect for properties with higher product involvement, higher product quality, and lower agent service quality. This demonstrates VR’s ability in enhancing information richness to satisfy consumers’ information needs for a higher level of product involvement; establishing information credibility in discerning product quality; and serving as an alternative information source in lieu of low-quality agent services. We also disentangle the direct effect of VR Tour from the indirect effect of VR badge on consumers’ decision making to reveal VR’s effectiveness in product evaluation. This work contributes to the literature on nonimmersive VR and offers managerial implications, particularly in the context of property sales, high-involvement product marketing, and product presentation technologies in e-commerce."
ISR,2025,How to Make My Bug Bounty Cost-Effective? A Game-Theoretical Model,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0349,"To mitigate the threats from malicious exploitation of vulnerabilities, an increasing number of organizations across different industries have started incorporating bug bounty programs (BBPs) in their vulnerability management cycles. Whereas a BBP attracts external security researchers to facilitate the discovery of vulnerabilities in organizations’ information technology systems, it also increases the risks after the vulnerabilities are discovered. To deal with the trade-offs, organizations need to understand how to design an optimal bounty and evaluate the total cost of a BBP depending on several key factors. The industry is motivated to understand how the bounty and total costs are impacted by (i) the characteristics of the organization (e.g., security posture and patching complexity), (ii) security researchers (e.g., the heterogeneity among security researchers and their number), and (iii) other factors such as the legal framework surrounding the BBP. However, because there is a lack of formal analyses regarding these issues, we use game-theoretical models to shed light on relevant questions and provide several useful results and managerial insights. First, although an organization’s patching complexity and the bounty act as substitutes, the relationship between security posture and the bounty is not necessarily substitutive or complementary. Furthermore, having a larger number of or more capable security researchers does not necessarily imply an increased bounty or lower total costs. Moreover, whereas the prevalent business belief is that an increased level of legal protection offered to the security researchers increases the cost of the BBP, we find that neither the cost of the BBP nor the offered bounty necessarily increases or decreases. This nuanced finding depends on different types of costs incurred because of the inherent vulnerability itself and costs related to possible leaks out of the BBP.

Impact of Rival’s Expertise Signals on Online User Engagement,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0282,"How does information on a rival’s expertise influence the focal user’s engagement in online competitive settings? Online competitive settings differ fundamentally from other online contexts, such as e-commerce and social media platforms, explored in the prior work. This contextual distinction, we argue, is important as it determines the relationship between information about others and the focal user’s engagement. The relevance of this question relates to broader theoretical ambiguities concerning the effects of status and past performance as relative and absolute signals of expertise. Our findings are based on a field experiment in which we modified the multiround mobile two-player gaming app interface, randomly exposing players to rival’s status and past performance signals. We measure the focal user’s engagement regarding their decision to continue the game after each round. As a baseline, we find that the focal user is less likely to continue the game if the rival exhibits higher current performance. However, the rival’s status and past performance signals create strong contingencies wherein the principle effect of current performance is stronger if the rival has a high status or moderate past performance. Further, these contingent effects are partly predicated on the focal player’s motivation to compete. These findings offer several important implications for driving user engagement in online competitive settings and meaningfully advance our current understanding of the effects of status and past performance information on online engagement."
ISR,2025,Platform Governance with Algorithm-Based Content Moderation: An Empirical Study on Reddit,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0036,"With increasing volumes of participation in social media and online communities, content moderation has become an integral component of platform governance. Volunteer (human) moderators have thus far been the essential workforce for content moderation. Because volunteer-based content moderation faces challenges in achieving scalable, desirable, and sustainable moderation, many online platforms have recently started to adopt algorithm-based content moderation tools (bots). When bots are introduced into platform governance, it is unclear how volunteer moderators react in terms of their community-policing and -nurturing efforts. To understand the impacts of these increasingly popular bot moderators, we conduct an empirical study with data collected from 156 communities (subreddits) on Reddit. Based on a series of econometric analyses, we find that bots augment volunteer moderators by stimulating them to moderate a larger quantity of posts, and such effects are pronounced in larger communities. Specifically, volunteer moderators perform 20.9% more community policing, particularly over subjective rules. Moreover, in communities with larger sizes, volunteers also exert increased efforts in offering more explanations and suggestions after their community adopted bots. Notably, increases in activities are primarily driven by the increased need for nurturing efforts to accompany growth in subjective policing. Moreover, introducing bots to content moderation also improves the retention of volunteer moderators. Overall, we show that introducing algorithm-based content moderation into platform governance is beneficial for sustaining digital communities."
ISR,2025,"Less Artificial, More Intelligent: Understanding Affinity, Trustworthiness, and Preference for Digital Humans",https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0203,"Companies are beginning to deploy highly realistic-looking digital human agents (DHAs) controlled by increasingly realistic artificial intelligence (AI) for online customer service tasks often performed by chatbots. We conducted four major experiments to examine users’ perceptions (trustworthiness, affinity, and willingness to work with) and behaviors while using DHA via a mixed-method approach with data from quantitative surveys, qualitative interviews, direct observations, and neurophysiological measurements. Four different DHAs were used in our experiments, which included commercial products from two different vendors (which proved to be immature) and two future-focused ones (where participants were successfully led to believe that the human-controlled digital human was controlled by AI). The first study compared user perceptions of a DHA, a chatbot, and a human agent from a written description and found few differences between the DHA and the chatbot. The second study compared perceptions after using a commercially available DHA and a chatbot. Most participants reported problems using acurrentproduction implementation of DHA, either finding it uncanny or robotic or having trouble conversing with it. The third and fourth studies used a plausiblefuture-focused“Wizard of Oz” design by informing users that the DHA was controlled by AI when it was actually controlled by a human. Participants still preferred a human agent using video conferencing to the DHA, but after controlling for visual fidelity, we did not find evidence of differences between the human and the DHA. Current DHAs that have communication problems trigger greater affinity than chatbots but are otherwise similar to them. When the DHAs’ representation and communication ability match human ability, we failed to find differences between DHAs and human agents for simple customer service tasks. Our results also add to research on algorithm aversion and suggest that the anthropomorphic computer interfaces of DHA might alleviate algorithm aversion."
ISR,2025,Omnificence or Differentiation? An Empirical Study of Knowledge Structure and Career Development of IT Workers,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0634,"Amid the growing importance of information technology (IT) in the business landscape, the pivotal role of IT knowledge on the demand side of the labor market, at both industry and firm levels, is well documented. However, the important labor supply side concerning IT workers has remained largely unknown. This raises challenges about how IT professionals should strategically cultivate their IT knowledge structures toward a sustainable, well-compensated career path. This paper bridges this gap by examining how different types of IT knowledge structures of IT workers impact their salaries and job security over time. We theorize, define, and operationalize two new metrics to characterize the knowledge structures of an IT worker.Knowledge omnificencemeasures the breadth of an IT worker’s own knowledge structure, whereasknowledge differentiationassesses the extent of difference between one’s knowledge set and those of their peers. By analyzing extensive career data of IT workers from 2000 to 2016, we demonstrated that, on average, a high level of IT knowledge differentiation or omnificence yields positive economic returns for IT workers. However, there is an intriguing twist: such a positive relationship is not monotonic. The most advantageous strategy is to acquire IT knowledge at moderate levels of knowledge omnificence and differentiation. Further, our results revealed another new twist: to increase salary potential or pursue a better position, one should aim for knowledge omnificence, whereas those valuing job security should aim for knowledge differentiation. This aligns with our theoretical rationale that utilizes a structured framework, integrating the dynamic capability framework and the boundaryless career theory. Besides, we found that both knowledge omnificence and differentiation reduced gender disparity in the labor market. In particular, females benefited more, with a 14.74% (or 1.38%) increase in salary, from having a one-unit increase in knowledge omnificence (or differentiation). This study holds critical managerial implications for IT workers, firms, and policymakers. It emphasizes the importance of strategic management of IT knowledge structure in enabling IT workers to thrive in the dynamic and competitive IT job market."
ISR,2025,The Effect of Voice AI on Digital Commerce,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0140,"Voice-activated shopping assistants (voice AI), such as Amazon Alexa and Alibaba Tmall Genie, have been gaining popularity worldwide as a new channel for online shopping. In this paper, we analyze large-scale archival data of consumer-level purchase records from Alibaba, the world’s largest e-commerce platform, to empirically investigate how consumers’ adoption of Tmall Genie affects their consumption. The results show that the average consumer’s weekly spending the e-commerce platform increased by 16.6% within the first four months after adopting voice AI. Additionally, we explore specific product features that moderate the effect of Genie adoption by examining repeat purchases, product substitutability, and familiarity, supporting a mechanism that involves reducing information acquisition costs. The positive effects of Genie adoption remain significant on repeat purchases in the long term, although they attenuate over time. Furthermore, our analyses reveal that on average, the voice channel has a positive spillover effect on spending on the PC channel but no significant effect on the mobile channel. The channel dynamics are contingent on specific shopping contexts. Our results demonstrate that voice AI devices with shopping capabilities can enhance the growth of the affiliated e-commerce platform. As the first study to empirically examine the impact of voice AI adoption on e-commerce consumption, our paper provides valuable implications for e-commerce platforms and retailers leveraging voice-activated shopping."
ISR,2025,The Effect of Popularity Cues and Peer Endorsements on Assertive Social Media Ads,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0606,"Social media platforms, such as Facebook, often display assertive call-to- action ads that encourage direct conversion actions, such as purchasing a product or installing an app. Additionally, these ads can display popularity signals (i.e., “likes”) and social endorsement from friends (i.e., friends’ “likes”). We examine the effectiveness of displaying these different signals on such ads in generating clicks through field tests conducted on Facebook. We collaborated with a mobile app company and conducted a call-to-action ad campaign on Facebook, targeting unique user groups with this type of ads for a mobile app. Our findings reveal that the overall number of “likes” associated with the ad does not impact the user’s decision to click the ad. Additionally, ads endorsed by friends have a lower clicking performance compared with those without such endorsement. Further analyses based on randomized laboratory studies and additional field tests using different products and apps confirm these results and demonstrate that the presence of these cues activates users’ persuasion knowledge of assertive call-to-action ads, resulting in a lower click performance. Furthermore, the negative impact of social cues is particularly pronounced when there is low similarity between users and their friends. These results have significant implications for the design of assertive call-to-action ads on social media platforms."
ISR,2025,Promoting Security Behaviors in Remote Work Environments: Personal Values Shaping Information Security Policy Compliance,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0563,"Cybersecurity threats and information security policy (ISP) compliance are critical concerns for organizations. The recent trend of working from home has made individual characteristics more relevant in fostering ISP compliance. Whereas extant research has theorized and offered alternatives to induce ISP compliance, most studies have failed to consider the differences between onsite and remote workers to motivate compliance with ISPs and have instead focused on standard interventions without considering personal characteristics. One of the few models including factors related to individuals’ characteristics is the unified model of information security policy compliance (UMISPC). This paper extends the UMISPC by drawing on Schwartz’s universal theory of personal values. We propose the values construct as a robust representation of an individual’s motivations to comply with an ISP. We confirm that personal values are significant predictors of compliance with ISPs. Furthermore, a comparison between onsite and remote workers suggests that personal values are more relevant in remote work settings. Our findings shed light on the values and individual characteristics that are important motivators for ISP compliance and how they differ for onsite and remote workers. Our results suggest that people’s personal motivations should be considered in promoting organizations’ ISPs and that organizations’ interventions should be tailored by understanding what values motivate or hinder ISP compliance."
ISR,2025,Understanding the Dynamic and Episodic Nature of Technostressors and Their Effects on Cyberdeviance: A Daily Field Investigation,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2020.0273,"Technostress is an emerging topic in the information systems (IS) literature. Prior studies have mostly adopted a static approach to capturing snapshots of technostressors, without considering their dynamic and episodic nature. Daily technostress is often the product of discrete events encountered in the workplace that shape employees’ momentary affect and behaviors in situ. To lay the conceptual foundation for understanding deviant behaviors, this study integrates the self-regulation perspective into the transactional model of stress and conducts a contextualized, longitudinal, and daily investigation of how and when daily perceived technostressors affect employees’ daily cyberdeviant behaviors (i.e., cyberdeviance). In a time-lagged experience sampling study of 188 professionals who completed a survey three times a day for two weeks, we found that employees experiencing daily techno-overload and techno-invasion are likely to engage in daily cyberdeviance to cope with their daily exhaustion. We also examined the cross-level moderating effect of an individual trait (i.e., technology self-efficacy) on the strength of the within-person process model of daily cyberdeviance. Our multilevel analysis results showed that technology self-efficacy alleviated employees’ daily exhaustion induced by daily techno-overload. This study theoretically contributes to the IS literature by providing a theoretical explanation of the underlying mechanisms of techno-overload, techno-invasion, and employees’ cyberdeviance, in addition to using a within-person approach to understand the dynamic and episodic nature of these technostressors."
ISR,2025,Better Is Better? Signaling Paradoxes in Performance-Based Advertising,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0419,"Advertising signaling theory shows that costly advertising can serve as a credible signal of product quality (hereafterad-signal), provided that the effectiveness of advertising can be accurately measured. The rise of performance-based advertising, in which advertising is paid based on consumer actions, such as clicking on or purchasing through an ad link, presents challenges in measuring the effectiveness of advertising. Specifically, it becomes difficult to differentiate whether a consumer’s action is caused by ad-signal or the inherent product appeal. This leads to a critical question: how does this inaccuracy in evaluating advertising effectiveness affect the signaling role of advertising? This research analyzes how the inherent product reputation and the breadth of ad-signal reach impact the signaling role of advertising, uncovering two paradoxes under performance-based advertising: a higher product reputation does not necessarily help advertising to signal product quality (product reputation paradox), and a broader ad-signal reach can impede the signaling role of advertising (ad-signal reach paradox). We propose modified payment schemes to address both paradoxes. These insights contribute to advertising signaling theory and offer practical guidance for designing effective payment schemes under performance-based advertising."
ISR,2025,Opening First-Party App Resources: Empirical Evidence of Free-Riding,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0607,"Platform owners are releasing their own apps on their platforms. These first-party apps (FPAs) typically leverage platform resources more effectively, competitively threatening rivals. Although the impact of FPAs on rivals’ innovation has been the subject of extensive study, the dominant view in previous research assumes that these FPAs are closed to third-party apps (TPAs). However, there is an increasing trend of FPAs opening their resources to TPAs, as they provide application programming interfaces (APIs) allowing TPAs to access their resources. Rivals still exist, as many TPAs choose not to have access to FPAs’ open resources because of their limited control over these resources. Does opening an FPA’s resources impact rivals’ innovation? The answer to the question is largely unknown. We exploit the release of the Apple Health Records API, a feature that opens Apple Health Records to TPAs, to design a quasi-experiment that investigates whether and how opening an FPA’s resources influence rivals’ innovations. Through several analyses, we conclude that opening an FPA’s resources to TPAs generates free-riding benefits for rivals. Moreover, these benefits mainly arise because of the growing presence of TPAs that do not adopt FPAs’ open resources in the market. We discuss the theoretical contributions and practical implications of our findings."
ISR,2025,"Timely Quality Problem Resolution in Peer-Production Systems: The Impact of Bots, Policy Citations, and Contributor Experience",https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2020.0485,"Although online peer-production systems have proven to be effective in producing high-quality content, their open call for participation makes them susceptible to ongoing quality problems. A key concern is that the problems should be addressed quickly to prevent low-quality content from remaining in place for extended periods. We examine the impacts of two control mechanisms, bots and policy citations, and the number of contributors, with and without prior experience in editing an article, on the cleanup time of 4,473 quality problem events in Wikipedia. We definecleanup timeas the time it takes to resolve a quality problem once it has been detected in an article. Using an accelerated failure time model, we find that the number of bots editing an article during a quality problem event has no effect on cleanup time; that citing policies to justify edits during the event is associated with a longer cleanup time; and that more contributors, with or without prior experience in editing the article, are associated with a shorter cleanup time. We also find important interactions between each of the two control mechanisms and the number of different types of contributors. There is a marginal increase in cleanup time that is larger when an increase in the number of contributors is accompanied by fewer bots editing the article during a quality problem event. This interaction effect is more pronounced when increasing the number of contributors without prior experience in editing the article. Further, there is a marginal decrease in cleanup time that is larger when an increase in the number of contributors, with or without prior experience in editing the article, is accompanied by fewer policy citations. Taken together, our results show that the use of bots and policy citations as control mechanisms must be considered in conjunction with the number of contributors with and without prior experience in editing an article. Accordingly, the number of contributors and their experience alone may not explain important outcomes in peer production; it is also important to find an appropriate mix of different control mechanisms and types of contributors to address quality problems quickly."
ISR,2025,Mispricing and Algorithm Trading,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0570,"The widespread adoption of information technology has fundamentally transformed the way information is processed in the financial market. One such technological advancement is algorithm trading, which allows traders to develop sophisticated strategies based on historical price data. This raises important questions: Do these algorithm trading strategies contribute to market instability? When do they yield profits for different market participants? To address these questions, we must move beyond the efficient market hypothesis, as this theory would suggest that such strategies yield no profit due to market efficiency. Instead, we explicitly incorporate initial market mispricing into our analysis and develop a stylized continuous-time model of algorithm feedback trading to investigate market outcomes. Our model yields closed-form solutions, enabling us to assess the degree to which the price diverges from the efficient level. We discover that algorithmic trading, when combined with initial market mispricing, can lead to significant market volatility, resulting in financial bubbles and crashes. However, this scenario only occurs when there is overpricing and the algorithm traders collectively employ a strategy that enlarges the mispricing. Depending on the initial mispricing in the form of underpricing or overpricing, different algorithm trading strategies (positive or negative) have different market impact, profitability, and policy implications."
ISR,2025,Making Lemonade from Lemons: A Transaction Cost Economics Perspective on Third-Party Disruptions in a Multivendor Information Technology Service,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0033,"In modern enterprise computing environments, multiple information technology (IT) services from first and third parties are often integrated to form coherent solutions for business customers. Using transaction cost economics (TCE) as a theoretical foundation, we seek to understand how uncertainties introduced by third-party services shape enterprise customers’ use of various IT services in these multivendor service settings. Specifically, we analyze a case of service disruption caused by a third party that affects the multivendor service but does not directly affect the first-party services. In line with the tenets of TCE, we find a temporary increase in the use of first-party services that can serve as a similar-goal substitute to fulfill the organization’s needs during the disruption; however, on average, we observe a net decline in the total use of services in the long run. We empirically analyze the role of first-party technical support during the disruption. Based on textual data from the first party’s technical support log, we use deep learning to assess what actions the first party can take during such disruptions to turn the challenge into an opportunity. We find that if the first party offers high-quality technical support that specifically addresses issues related to its product, it may be able to make lemonade out of lemons. Such technical support effectively boosts customers’ use of first-party services in the long run. Curiously, however, similar efforts by the first party in the predisruption period are ineffective in achieving the same effect."
ISR,2025,Strategic Content Generation and Monetization in Financial Social Media,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0482,"Financial social media platforms, which rely on social media analysts (SMAs) to contribute content to investors, have emerged as a crucial channel for investors to gain access to financial information and for SMAs to monetize their content. However, we still have a limited understanding of the factors that affect how content is generated and monetized in financial social media platforms. This study focuses on the novel role of investors’ preferences for free/paid content and its sentiment and investigates the extent to which SMAs exhibit strategic content generation and monetization behaviors by catering to and trading off the investors’ preferences. We also evaluate the underlying mechanisms and implications of such strategic behaviors. Utilizing a data set from a financial social media platform based in China, we propose a Bayesian empirical model to jointly analyze the investor’s demand and SMAs’ strategic supply of financial social media content. The model estimation results show that SMAs cater to investors’, especially paid subscribers’, preferences in their content generation such that their strategic behaviors account for 46.20% (24.50%) of the variation in SMAs’ generation decision for free (paid) content sentiment. In addition, an SMA is more likely to produce paid content when the expected free readership increases and is less likely to do so when the expected paid subscriptions increase, evidence that SMAs do balance the preferences of different investors when monetizing content. We find that SMAs are strategic in acquiring readers via their content monetization decisions and retaining subscribers via their content generation decisions. Importantly, we uncover that the orientation of an SMA’s strategic catering behavior is driven by the audience composition effect. Our study provides new empirical evidence, associated theoretical explanations for the results, and a practical illustration of an approach to reduce the potential confirmation bias of investors who may favor information from some SMAs that are prone to strategic catering behaviors."
ISR,2025,How Recommendation Affects Customer Search: A Field Experiment,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0294,"Product recommendation and search are two technology-mediated channels through which e-commerce platforms can help customers find products. However, the relationship between the two channels and the underlying mechanisms and implications for platform design are not well understood. We leverage a randomized field experiment with 555,800 customers on a large e-commerce platform to investigate how product recommendation affects customer search. We vary the relevance of the recommendation that users experience upon arriving at the home page of the platform and find that a decrease in recommendation relevance leads to a significant increase in consumers’ use of the search channel, indicating a (partial) substitution effect between the two at the aggregate level. We find substantial heterogeneity across product categories, propose a conceptual framework, and theorize how different states of customer demand—demand fulfillment and demand formation—may drive such heterogeneity. The results are aligned with our framework and provide evidence that both demand formation and fulfillment are at work in the channel interactions between recommendation and search. Specifically, when customers receive more product recommendations in a category, they search more in that category with generic query words, which indicates complementarity between recommendation and search. However, when customers receive fewer product recommendations in a category of interest, they compensate for this reduction by searching more in that category with long-tail query words, which indicates a substitution between recommendation and search. This experimental study is among the first to examine the causal relationship between the recommendation channel and search channel and offers implications for the design of e-commerce platforms."
ISR,2025,Understanding Volunteer Crowdsourcing from a Multiplex Perspective,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0290,"Crowdsourcing is about leveraging information technologies to outsource tasks to a large group of people, who can either be paid workers or nonpaid workers. Differing from monetarily incentivized workers, nonpaid workers are more likely to be affected by coworking relationships. To explore the link between the network and volunteering behavior, we construct dynamic collaboration networks from 827,260 unique volunteers’ participation in 183,445 projects initiated by 74,556 nonprofit organizations over nine years in the capital city of China. Following a multiplex perspective, we allow each type of organization (i.e., school-based, community-based, other-based) to represent a separate network layer. We construct the measures of multiplex ties (i.e., social connections that are linked through multiple layers) and relational pluralism (i.e., involvement diversity in different layers). We find that volunteers with more multiplex ties and a lower level of relational pluralism have higher volunteering continuity and intensity of engagement, guaranteeing the supply of the volunteer labor force. However, they are less likely to explore unfamiliar organizations through interorganization movements. At a macro level, we show how the reduced interorganization movements impeded the development of small and newly established organizations. In addition, we show that incorporating these multiplexity measures improves the prediction of volunteer behavior by 5.390%, 1.624%, and 8.792% for continuity, movement, and engagement, respectively."
ISR,2025,Regulating Powerful Platforms: Evidence from Commission Fee Caps,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0191,"Platform giants typically possess strong power over other participants on the platforms. Such power asymmetry gives platform owners the edge on setting platform fees to capture the surplus created on their platforms. Although there is a heated debate on regulating these powerful platforms, the lack of empirical studies hinders the progress toward evidence-based policymaking. This research empirically investigates this regulatory issue in the context of on-demand delivery. Delivery platforms (e.g., DoorDash) charge restaurants a commission fee, which can be as high as 30% per order. To support small businesses, recent regulatory scrutiny has started to cap the commission fees for independent restaurants. This research empirically evaluates the effectiveness of platform fee regulation, by investigating recent regulations across 14 cities and states in the United States. Our analyses show that independent restaurants in regulated cities (i.e., those paying reduced commission fees) experience a decline in orders and revenue, whereas chain restaurants (i.e., those paying the original fees) see an increase in orders and revenue. This intriguing finding suggests that chain restaurants, not independent restaurants, benefit from the regulations that were intended to support independent restaurants. We find that platforms’ discriminative responses to the regulation may explain the negative effects on independent restaurants. That is, after cities enact commission fee caps, delivery platforms become less likely to recommend independent restaurants to consumers, and instead turn to promoting chain restaurants. Moreover, delivery platforms increase their delivery fees for consumers in regulated cities, suggesting that these platforms attempt to cover the loss of commission revenue by charging customers more."
ISR,2025,Understanding Lenders’ Investment Behavior in Online Peer-to-Peer Lending: A Construal Level Theory Perspective,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2020.0428,"Online peer-to-peer lending (i.e., P2P lending) has grown rapidly in recent years and is a new source of fixed income for investors. However, there is limited understanding of factors affecting individual lenders’ decision making in this context, which is characterized as highly risky. Drawing on construal level theory, we theorize how bidding amounts lenders submit are affected by interest rates and psychological distance caused by the borrower’s demographic attributes (i.e., geographic location, age, educational degree, and marital status) relative to those of the lender. Specifically, we study how psychological distance directly influences and shapes the effects of the duality of interest rates (i.e., as rates of return and as signals of potential risk) on bidding amounts. Using a rich data set from a popular Chinese online P2P lending platform, we apply multiple identification strategies and estimation methods to conduct our analyses. We find that geographic distance decreases the lenders’ bidding amounts (i.e.,home bias effect), whereas social distance increases the bidding amounts (i.e.,social distance effect). In addition, the positive effects of interest rates on bidding amounts are strengthened by the geographic and social distance between the lender and the borrower. Furthermore, we conduct four controlled experiments to explore the causality and mechanisms behind these relationships. Theoretical contributions and practical implications are discussed."
ISR,2025,Enhancing User Privacy Through Ephemeral Sharing Design: Experimental Evidence from Online Dating,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0379,"Users on online dating platforms tend to encounter a cold-start problem, with limited user engagement in the initial stages of the matching process; this is partially due to privacy concerns. In this study, we propose ephemeral sharing as a privacy-enhancing design to strike a balance between users’ privacy concerns and the need for voluntary information disclosure. Ephemeral sharing refers to a digital design in which the information shared (e.g., a personal photo) becomes invisible and irretraceable to the receiver shortly after the receipt of such information. In partnership with an online dating platform, we report a large-scale randomized field experiment with more than 70,000 users to understand how ephemeral sharing influences users’ disclosure of personal photos, match outcome, and receiver engagement. The experiment features a treatment group in which subjects can upload an ephemeral photo along with their matching request and a control group in which subjects can instead upload a persistent photo. We find that users in the treatment group send more personal photos (and ones with human faces) compared with users in the control group. Additionally, the ephemeral sharing treatment leads to a higher number of matches and a higher level of receiver engagement. Further analyses suggest that the treatment effects are more salient for privacy-sensitive senders. Moreover, we find that the treatment effects on match outcome and receiver engagement can be explained by increases in the disclosure of personal photos. Last, through an online experiment, we show that ephemeral sharing increases disclosure intention by reducing privacy concerns related to data collection, dissemination, and identity abuse. Our study contributes to the literature and practice on privacy-enhancing designs for online matching platforms."
ISR,2025,Mobile Push vs. Pull Targeting and Geo-Conquesting,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0206,"This study examines the impact of different mobile content delivery mechanisms on consumers’ coupon redemption behavior. Firms have two distinct content delivery options when engaging with consumers’ mobile devices:mobile pushandmobile pull. Mobile push delivers firm-initiated (ad) content directly to consumers, whereas mobile pull requires consumers to initiate requests for (ad) content. We hypothesize that mobile push delivery increases the likelihood of coupon redemption due to reduced app-specific search costs compared with mobile pull. We further examine how app-specific use experience and store density influence the heterogeneity of consumer responses. To test our hypotheses, we conducted a large-scale randomized field experiment in a geo-conquesting setting, targeting customers located around competitor retail stores with mobile coupons to drive them to stores of the focal retailer. Our results reveal that mobile push increases coupon redemption rates by 6.0%, with substantial heterogeneity based on app-specific use experience and store density. Notably, app-specific usage experience negatively moderates the effect of mobile push delivery on redemptions, likely because both usage experience and push notifications reduce app-specific search costs, thereby acting as substitutes for one another. In areas with higher store density, the positive effect of mobile push delivery on the redemption likelihood is greater, suggesting that push notifications can highlight the focal coupon among alternative store choices, thereby lowering consumer switching costs. These findings have important implications for retailers and brands in creating competitive mobile targeting campaigns that effectively leverage both mobile push and pull delivery mechanisms."
ISR,2025,Signaling Effects Under Dynamic Capacity in Online Matching Platforms: Evidence from Online Health Consultation Communities,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0150,"Match formation is challenging in online matching platforms where suppliers are subject to dynamic capacity constraints. We provide a theoretical foundation for understanding how online matching platforms support the transmission and triangulation of multisource information for consumers to infer provider service quality and dynamic capacity states, and achieve desirable matching outcomes. Situating this study in the context of an online health consultation community (OHCC) and drawing upon signaling theory, we theorize how physicians’ owned and earned signals influence physicians’ voluntary online consultations with new patients they have not consulted with previously. Importantly, we articulate how these signaling effects are contingent upon physicians’ dynamic capacity in OHCC. We collected longitudinal data from a large OHCC in China and used a hidden Markov model (HMM) to characterize the dynamic physician capacity in the OHCC and test the hypotheses. Our findings reveal that service professionals’ owned and earned signals interactively work together to balance supply and demand dynamically, and thereby facilitating matchmaking. In OHCCs, where physicians provide voluntary service beyond their primary jobs at hospitals, we find that owned and earned signals increase patient consultations in different patterns contingent upon physicians’ capacity states. In addition, we discover the complementary and substitute relationships between owned signals and earned signals change when physicians are in different capacity states. The findings have significant implications for our understanding of online match formation under dynamic capacity constraints and the design of OHCCs."
ISR,2025,Linking Clicks to Bricks: Understanding the Effects of Email Advertising on Multichannel Sales,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2020.0557,"Businesses have widely used email ads to directly send promotional information to consumers. Whereas email ads serve as a convenient tool to allow firms to target consumers online, there is little evidence of their multichannel impact on consumer spending in both online and brick-and-mortar stores. In this paper, we utilize a unique high-dimensional data set from one of the world’s largest office supplies retailers to link each consumer’s online behaviors to item-level purchase records in physical stores. We employ a doubly robust estimator that incorporates nonparametric machine learning methods for causal estimation on observational data. Our results show that email ads significantly increase the retailer’s sales across different channels. We also investigate the effects of email ads on diverse consumer behaviors along the purchase funnel and find that increased sales result from increased purchase probability and a wider variety of products purchased by consumers. Further, we examine several moderating factors, such as product types and consumer segments, that influence the multichannel effects of email advertising. Overall, our study provides empirical evidence for the economic impact of email ads on consumer behavior across different channels and the underlying mechanisms thereof. Our findings offer direct implications for multichannel retailers seeking to improve their digital marketing strategies, as well as for policymakers interested in evaluating the economic impact of prevalent email advertising."
ISR,2025,How Hospitals Differentiate Health Information Technology Portfolios for Clinical Care Efficiency: Insights from the HITECH Act,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0260,"Hospitals have implemented health information technology (HIT) for clinical care to address rising operating costs in recent years. We integrate behavioral and institutional perspectives to explain how hospitals differentiate technological search relative to industry peers (i.e., search differentiation) for HIT portfolios. In the context of the U.S. healthcare industry, we theorize that hospitals’ search differentiation for HIT results jointly from idiosyncratic learning in response to cost-based performance shortfalls and isomorphic pressures in relation to changing policy uncertainty as the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act has unfolded. Based on a panel data set from 3,319 hospitals in 2007–2014, we demonstrate that when costs increase relative to aspiration level, a hospital differentiates its search for HIT by exploring more novel technologies for clinical care relative to peers. As policy uncertainty declines from the conceptualization phase to the enactment phase of the HITECH Act, a hospital’s search differentiation for HIT increases to a greater extent in response to cost-based performance shortfalls as lower uncertainty reduces the need to imitate peers’ search. As policy uncertainty further declines from the enactment phase to the enforcement phase of the HITECH Act and reaches its lowest level, however, the hospital’s search differentiation for HIT increases to a smaller extent in response to cost-based performance shortfalls because of policy incentives and professional norms to promote implementation of common technologies. Overall, we provide a more holistic picture of how uncertainty in a dynamic regulatory context intertwines with organizational learning from performance feedback in shaping search differentiation."
ISR,2025,Blessing or Curse? Implications of Data Brokers for Publisher Competition,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0227,"The abundance of consumer data has given rise to a new data broker industry that plays a pivotal role in targeted advertising. Many publishers rely on data brokers to gain (i)individual insightsdrawn from their own data or (ii)collective insightsdrawn from both their data and those of their competitors, thus improving their targeting capabilities. As data brokers control large volumes of data, they can govern how data insights are sold to downstream publishers. Despite their importance, prior studies provide little insight into the strategic function of data brokers and their subsequent impact on downstream competition. To address this research gap, we build an analytical model to analyze the interactions among a data broker, two competing publishers, and advertisers. Our analysis yields several novel findings. First, we show that the data broker may strategically set prices in a manner that leads to the exclusive selling of collective insights to one publisher, as opposed to nonexclusive selling involving two publishers. This result implies that it may be advantageous for the data broker to pursue an exclusive strategy that makes data insights scarcer for some firms. Second, we illustrate that competition between publishers can be either facilitated or impeded by the data broker depending on the broker’s interests when selling the data insights. Finally, the data broker may induce both competition-mitigation and value-enhancing effects that affect aggregate welfare. Interestingly, although the data broker’s decision (i.e., exclusive selling) may reduce market competition, the aggregate welfare can still improve because collective insights allow publishers to increase their targeting value for advertisers more efficiently."
ISR,2025,Punished for Success? A Natural Experiment of Displaying Clinical Hospital Quality on Review Platforms,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0630,"The healthcare market faces severe information asymmetry; patients struggle to evaluate the quality of hospitals and make informed decisions about their healthcare. Review platforms (e.g., Yelp) have begun to display the clinical quality of hospitals (alongside consumer reviews) to inform patients about hospital selection. In 2017 and 2019, Yelp introduced a feature with clinical measures of maternity care for hospitals that deliver babies in select markets. We study how clinical quality measures displayed on Yelp—especially for those (clinically) high-quality hospitals—influence subsequent patients’ ratings of hospitals. Our difference-in-differences estimation shows that when clinical quality measures are displayed, high-quality hospitals are surprisingly punished with lower subsequent ratings on Yelp, especially hospitals with low staffing capacity. This novel finding is consequential for hospitals as patient dissatisfaction can jeopardize the federal funding that hospitals receive (CMS.gov). To tease out the underlying mechanism, we queried SafeGraph’s precise foot traffic data, and we observed a significant patient surge for hospitals that have high maternity care clinical scores displayed on Yelp. We used transfer deep learning to show that because of the patient surge, (only) hospitals with high maternity scores that were short staffed received significantly more negative patient reviews and more complaints about key hospital service areas, thus driving patient dissatisfaction and lower ratings. We contribute to theory and practice by elucidating the role of publicly displaying clinical quality measures in patient (dis-)satisfaction with hospitals."
ISR,2025,"On-Demand, Long-Term, or Hybrid? An Economic Analysis of Optimal Rental Models on Sharing Platforms",https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0441,"The rapidly growing sharing economy is characterized by improved resource utilization through peer-to-peer transactions. Sharing platforms usually adopt one of three rental models, long-term, on-demand, and hybrid, where the long-term rental requires full dedication of resources to market over a predefined period, the on-demand rental allows resources to be exchanged for a fraction of the period, and the hybrid rental model provides both options. We develop an analytical model consisting of a monopolistic sharing platform that connects renters with owners who have heterogeneous asset utilization and incur different setup and transaction costs of participation under different rental models. We identify the conditions under which each of the three rental models can emerge as the platform’s optimal rental strategy and further examine their impacts on social welfare and consumer surplus. We find that the relative setup cost and the relative transaction cost between owners and renters play a crucial role in shaping the equilibrium market price and optimality of the three rental models, whereas the total costs determine the equilibrium transaction volume and sustainability of the three rental models. Only when the total cost is low can all three models be sustainable, and each model could emerge to be optimal in the presence of a moderately high relative transaction cost on the owners’ side. Specifically, when the owners’ setup cost is significantly higher than the renters’, the on-demand model is optimal. When the owners’ setup cost is significantly lower than the renters’ and the renter’s setup cost is low, the long-term model is optimal. Only when their setup costs are comparable or when the owners’ setup cost is significantly lower than the renters’ and the renter’s setup cost is high can the hybrid model be optimal. When the platform optimally chooses the long-term or hybrid model, it also generates the highest social welfare, and in a wide range of parameter regions, it also yields the highest consumer surplus, leading to a win–win outcome. Overall, our results offer important new insights into the platform’s optimal rental-model choice in the sharing economy and its implications for consumers and society."
ISR,2025,Gaining a Seat at the Table: Enhancing the Attractiveness of Online Lending for Institutional Investors,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0638,"Although online lending enjoyed explosive growth in the past decade, its market size remains small compared with other financial assets. The risk of losing money, stringent government regulations, and low awareness of the benefits have hampered the realization of the full potential of the online lending market. Because online loans are an emerging asset class, investors may not be aware of the investment performance of online loans compared with other assets, and it remains an open question whether online loans offer sufficiently attractive returns to warrant inclusion in an asset allocation decision. To attract lenders, platforms must provide an appealing investment opportunity which entails construction of portfolios of loans that investors find attractive. We propose general characteristics-based portfolio policy (GCPP), a novel framework to overcome the difficulties associated with portfolio construction of loans. GCPP directly models the portfolio weight of a loan as a flexible function of its characteristics and does not require direct estimation of the distributional properties of loans. Using an extensive data set spanning over one million loans from 2013 to 2020 from LendingClub, we show that GCPP portfolios can achieve an average annualized internal rate of return (IRR) of 8.86%–13.08%, significantly outperforming an equal-weight portfolio of loans. We then address the question of whether online loans can earn competitive rates of return compared with traditional investment vehicles through six market indices covering stocks, bonds, and real estate. The results demonstrate that a portfolio of online loans earns competitive or higher rates of return compared with traditional asset classes. Furthermore, the IRRs of the loan portfolios have small correlations with the benchmark index IRRs, pointing toward significant diversification benefits. Together, we demonstrate that GCPP is an approach that can help platforms better serve both borrowers and lenders en route to growing their business."
ISR,2025,Growing Technological Relatedness to the ICT Industry and Its Impacts,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2020.0627,"We create an intersectoral citation network using 1.3 million patents granted between 1981 and 2010 across all industries in the United States. In this network space, we find a significant increase over time in the proximity of non–information and communication technologies (ICT) industries to the ICT industry. Such “ICT-closeness” of an industry relates to a significant increase in the proportion of ICT technologies in the industry’s patent portfolio and complementarity between ICT and non-ICT patents in its portfolio. We hypothesize and find that ICT-Closeness has a significant positive impact on innovation outcomes of the citing industry, including innovative efficiency, recombinant capabilities, and creation of new products, services, and business methods. ICT-closeness also engenders hypercompetition in the citing industries, as reflected in greater winner-take-all dynamics and turbulence. Our results point to a paradigm shift in knowledge production, and in turn, sources of competitive value across diverse industries."
ISR,2025,Guided Diverse Concept Miner (GDCM): Uncovering Relevant Constructs for Managerial Insights from Text,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2020.0494,"Guided Diverse Concept Miner (GDCM) is an interpretable deep learning algorithm to (1) automatically extract corpus-level concepts from text data, (2) focus the discovery of concepts to filter through only the concepts highly correlated to the user-specified managerial outcome, and (3) quantify the concept’s correlational importance to the outcome. GDCM is used to explore and potentially extract previously unknown concepts and insights from the text that may explain the managerial outcome, without the need to provide any human-predefined guidance or labeled data on concepts. GDCM embeds words, documents, and concepts all in the same vector space, enabling easy interpretation of discovered concepts by associating words local to the concept vector. GDCM is explicitly configured to increase recovered-concept diversity, coherence, and relevance to managerial outcomes. We demonstrate GDCM as a “guided exploratory” tool for a hypothetical managerial case involving online purchase journey data connected to consumed reviews. GDCM scalably extracts concepts hidden in customer reviews highly correlated to conversion and provides concept importance in comparison with product ratings. Concepts produced turn out to be product qualities previously theorized to impact conversion in the literature, and correlational importance gauged by GDCM closely matches estimates from a previous causal study run on a similar data set, serving as external validations of GDCM as a “guided exploratory” tool. Additional experiments with other data show that extracted insights are sensitive to guiding managerial variables and sensibly so, further demonstrating the flexibility of GDCM as a managerial tool."
ISR,2025,"1 + 1 > 2? Information, Humans, and Machines",https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0305,"With the explosive growth of data and the rapid rise of artificial intelligence and automated working processes, humans inevitably fall into increasingly close collaboration with machines as either employees or consumers. Problems in human–machine interaction arise as a consequence, not to mention the dilemmas posed by the need to manage information on ever-expanding scales. Considering the general superiority of machines in this latter respect, compared with human performance, it is essential to explore whether human–machine collaboration is valuable and, if so, why. Recent studies propose diverse explanation methods to uncover machine learning algorithms’ “black boxes,” aiming to reduce human resistance and enhance efficiency. However, the findings of this literature stream have been inconclusive. Little is known about the influential factors involved or the rationale behind their impacts on human decision processes. We aimed to tackle these issues in the present study by specifically examining the joint impact of information complexity and machine explanations. Specifically, we cooperated with a large Asian microloan company to conduct a two-stage field experiment. Drawing upon studies in dual-process theories of reasoning that propose different conditions necessary to arouse humans’ active information processing and systematic thinking, we tailored the treatments to vary the level of information complexity, the presence of collaboration, and the availability of machine explanations. We observed that, with large volumes of information and with machine explanations alone, human evaluators could not add extra value to the final collaborative outcomes. However, when extensive information was coupled with machine explanations, human involvement significantly reduced the default rate compared with machine-only decisions. We disentangled the underlying mechanisms with three-step empirical analyses. We reveal that the coexistence of large-scale information and machine explanations can invoke humans’ active rethinking, which, in turn, shrinks gender gaps and increases prediction accuracy. In particular, we demonstrate that humans can spontaneously associate newly emerging features with others that had been overlooked but had the potential to correct the machine’s mistakes. This capacity not only underscores the necessity of human–machine collaboration, but also offers insights into system designs. Our experiments and empirical findings provide nontrivial implications that are both theoretical and practical."
ISR,2025,Firm-Sponsored Online Communities: Building Alignment Capabilities for Participatory Governance,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0578,"Firm-sponsored online communities face governance challenges because of differences in the goals and values between the community and the sponsor. This study focuses on better understanding how these communities combine firm-based and community-based governance to achieve participatory governance, balancing firm goals with the autonomy and participation of volunteer members. Through a case study of Mayo Clinic Connect, an online patient community sponsored by Mayo Clinic, we uncover how firm and community stakeholders jointly align firm- and community-based governance. We introduce the concept of a governance alignment capability, which helps avoid and resolve governance tensions, contributing to the success of participatory governance. We specifically uncover two governance alignment mechanisms: informalizing the formal and formalizing the informal. These mechanisms adapt firm-based governance to align more closely with community norms and standardize community-based governance within the firm’s governance structure. The study contributes to both the nascent literature on firm-sponsored online communities and the broader literature on governance by highlighting the importance of participatory governance capabilities in balancing effectiveness and legitimacy in firm-sponsored online communities and emphasizing governance as a dynamic, rather than a static, system."
ISR,2025,Conversation Analytics: Can Machines Read Between the Lines in Real-Time Strategic Conversations?,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0415,"Strategic conversations involve one party with an informational advantage and another with an interest in the information. This paper proposes machine learning–based methods to quantify the evasiveness and incoherence of the more-informed party during real-time strategic conversations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in a real-world setting, we consider the question-and-answer sessions of earnings conference calls, during which managers face scrutinizing questions from analysts. Being reluctant to disclose adverse information, managers may resort to evasive answers and sometimes respond less coherently than they otherwise would. Using data from the earnings calls of S&P 500 companies from 2006 to 2018, we show that the proposed measures predict worse next-quarter earnings. The stock market also perceives incoherence as a negative signal. This paper contributes methodologically to business analytics by developing machine learning methods to extract behavioral cues from real-time strategic conversations. We believe the wide adoption of these tools can increase the efficiency of various markets and institutions where real-time strategic conversations routinely occur, which ultimately benefits business and society."
ISR,2025,The Impact of “Retail Media” on Online Marketplaces: Insights from a Field Experiment,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0188,"Advertising on e-commerce marketplaces, wherein sponsored product listings are interleaved with organic product listings in the search results, is a large and growing phenomenon that falls under the umbrella of “retail media.” In this paper, taking the perspective of the marketplace, we obtain insights into the impact of sponsored listings being shown at the most salient positions in the list of results. To do so, we analyze data from a large-scale field experiment at Flipkart, a leading online marketplace in India. We find nuanced results that substantially vary across categories. In the electronics category, the sponsored listings perform worse (in terms of clicks and conversions) than the organic listings that they replace, whereas the organic listings in the neighborhood of the sponsored listings perform better than in the absence of the sponsored listings. Surprisingly, these effects are reversed in the clothing and footwear categories, in which the ads perform better than the displaced organic listings, suggesting that sponsored listings might help the platform identify new high-relevance products and improve search rankings for these categories. However, at the search level, because of the countervailing impacts on sponsored listings and neighboring organic listings (even though the directions of these effects are different for different categories), we find that increasing the fraction of sponsored listings (by about 10% points) does not affect clicks and conversions in any product category. This implies that ads bring in additional revenue for the marketplace yet do not hurt overall consumer response (in the short run). We theorize that the variation across categories occurs because of differing degrees of information asymmetry on product relevance to a query between the marketplace and the independent sellers of listed products and provide supporting evidence for this mechanism."
ISR,2025,Improving Students’ Argumentation Skills Using Dynamic Machine-Learning–Based Modeling,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0615,"Argumentation is an omnipresent rudiment of daily communication and thinking. The ability to form convincing arguments is not only fundamental to persuading an audience of novel ideas but also plays a major role in strategic decision making, negotiation, and constructive, civil discourse. However, humans often struggle to develop argumentation skills, owing to a lack of individual and instant feedback in their learning process, because providing feedback on the individual argumentation skills of learners is time-consuming and not scalable if conducted manually by educators. Grounding our research in social cognitive theory, we investigate whether dynamic technology-mediated argumentation modeling improves students’ argumentation skills in the short and long term. To do so, we built a dynamic machine-learning (ML)–based modeling system. The system provides learners with dynamic writing feedback opportunities based on logical argumentation errors irrespective of instructor, time, and location. We conducted three empirical studies to test whether dynamic modeling improves persuasive writing performance more so than the benchmarks of scripted argumentation modeling (H1) and adaptive support (H2). Moreover, we assess whether, compared with adaptive support, dynamic argumentation modeling leads to better persuasive writing performance on both complex and simple tasks (H3). Finally, we investigate whether dynamic modeling on repeated argumentation tasks (over three months) leads to better learning in comparison with static modeling and no modeling (H4). Our results show that dynamic behavioral modeling significantly improves learners’ objective argumentation skills across domains, outperforming established methods like scripted modeling, adaptive support, and static modeling. The results further indicate that, compared with adaptive support, the effect of the dynamic modeling approach holds across complex (large effect) and simple tasks (medium effect) and supports learners with lower and higher expertise alike. This work provides important empirical findings related to the effects of dynamic modeling and social cognitive theory that inform the design of writing and skill support systems for education. This paper demonstrates that social cognitive theory and dynamic modeling based on ML generalize outside of math and science domains to argumentative writing."
ISR,2025,Addressing Online Users’ Suspicion of Sponsored Search Results: Effects of Informational Cues,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0364,"Sponsored search results (SSRs) that deviate from users’ search queries often raise suspicion despite receiving positive evaluations from previous users. Such a suspicion typically prompts users to avoid SSRs. To address this issue, our study focuses on the role of online informational cues, such as product reviews and ratings from user-generated content, in reducing users’ suspicion when encountering these SSRs. Drawing on the theoretical perspective of state suspicion, we contextualize the dimensions of suspicion in the SSR context, includingdecision uncertainty,perceived malintent of the search platform, andprocessing of an SSR. We propose theory-based strategies for reducing the suspicion of users by incorporating informational cues about an SSR in the product search process in e-commerce contexts. Specifically, we theorize that the internalization of an informational cue can reduce users’ decision uncertainty and/or their perceived malintent of the platform, which will increase their processing of an SSR. Our approach also considers contingent factors that trigger users’ internalization. We conducted three laboratory experiments, and the results support our theorization. Our study uncovers the internalization mechanism of informational cues in addressing the suspicion of users in online information search contexts and offers practical implications to e-commerce platforms to facilitate users’ decision-making processes."
ISR,2025,Customer Acquisition via Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0529,"Effective customer acquisition heavily hinges on sequential targeting to ensure that appropriate marketing messages reach customers. Sequential targeting could guide customers through the acquisition process and thus, optimize long-term revenue for the firm. Toward this goal, reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated great potential in facilitating sequential targeting during user acquisition. However, decisions made by RL during this process often lack explainability. We introduce the deep recurrent Q-network with attention model, which optimizes the long-term reward of sequential targeting while enhancing the explainability of the decisions. The key idea of the proposed model is to revise Q-learning by adding an attention mechanism to create a bottleneck, forcing the model to focus on features of the next ad exposure that will lead to optimal long-term rewards. We estimate our model using a comprehensive data set from a digital bank. The empirical results show that the proposed model is explainable and also outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of long-term revenue optimization. Specifically, the attention mechanism within the model functions as forward planning. The forward planning can spot those features in the next ad exposure that are more likely to lead to the optimal outcome. We further demonstrate how the model makes targeting decisions of advertising channel choices by showing that the model can (1) learn optimal ad channels to target customers from different industries, (2) adjust advertising channels in response to dynamic customer behaviors, and (3) learn the seasonality of the customer’s industry and calibrate the ad channel correspondingly."

We empirically test our framework on a large-scale demand data set from a leading on-demand delivery platform in Europe and find strong performance gains from using our framework against several industry benchmarks across all geographical regions, loss functions, and both pre- and post-COVID periods. We translate forecast gains to economic impacts for this on-demand service platform by computing financial gains and reductions in computing costs."
ISR,2025,KETCH: A Knowledge-Enhanced Transformer-Based Approach to Suicidal Ideation Detection from Social Media Content,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0619,"Suicidal ideation (SI), as a psychiatric emergency, requires immediate assistance and intervention. Most people with SI do not actively seek help from mental health professionals, which may result in irreversible consequences. Research has shown that individuals experiencing SI increasingly express their thoughts and emotions on social media platforms, making the latter a viable venue for suicidal ideation detection (SID). This paper proposes, develops, and evaluates a knowledge-enhanced transformer-based approach (KETCH) to SID from social media content. KETCH comprises several key novel design artifacts, including a social media-oriented SI lexicon, a model-level method for integrating domain knowledge (i.e., lexicon) into a state-of-the-art transformer, and aligned dynamic embedding and lexicon-based enhancement that integrate domain relevance and contextual importance of terms to effective SID. We evaluate KETCH’s performance with social media data in two different languages collected from distinct platforms, and further examine its generalizability to user-level models for suicide risk prediction and depression detection. The results demonstrate the superior effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability of KETCH via a series of empirical evaluation and a field study. Our research makes multifold research contributions and opens up practical opportunities for timely detection and proactive intervention of SI, which can have far-reaching impacts on public health, the economy, and society."
ISR,2025,Monitoring and the Cold Start Problem in Digital Platforms: Theory and Evidence from Online Labor Markets,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0146,"Many online labor platforms employ reputation systems and monitoring systems to mitigate moral hazard. Whereas reputation systems have the potential to reduce moral hazard, they suffer from the cold-start problem, in which new entrants without an established reputation face a high entry barrier as employers predominantly select workers based on their existing reputation. Monitoring systems, providing employers with direct oversight of workers’ actions, offer a different approach. By tracking and reporting workers’ effort levels, monitoring systems reduce ex post information asymmetry and, thus, lower employers’ expected moral hazard risk from workers. However, unlike reputation systems, monitoring systems do not directly address ex ante information asymmetry, failing to assist employers in identifying the right workers. This inherent limitation raises questions about their effectiveness in resolving the cold-start problem. In this paper, we first propose a stylized theoretical model that characterizes worker entry in the presence of reputation and monitoring systems. Based on a unique data set from a leading online labor platform, we then empirically investigate the effect of monitoring systems on the entry barriers by examining the change in workers’ entry behaviors after the introduction of the monitoring system along with associated project outcomes, which include employers’ hiring preferences, hiring prices, and project performance. We exploit the differential availability of the monitoring system across two project types: time-based projects, for which the monitoring system is accessible, and fixed-price projects, for which it is not. Employing a difference-in-differences estimation with a sample including 9,344 fixed-price projects and 3,118 time-based projects, we report that the introduction of the monitoring system increases the number of bids on time-based projects by 27.8%, and the incremental bids predominantly originate from inexperienced workers who lack platform reputation. We further find that, following the introduction of the monitoring system, employers’ preference for experienced workers diminishes, accompanied by an average reduction of 19.5% in labor costs, whereas we observe no significant decrease in project completion and review rating. Our results collectively suggest that monitoring systems alleviate the cold-start problem in online platforms."
ISR,2025,A Nudge to Credible Information as a Countermeasure to Misinformation: Evidence from Twitter,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0491,"Fueled by social media, health misinformation is spreading rapidly across online platforms. Myths, rumors, and false information on vaccines are flourishing, and the aftermath can be disastrous. A more concerning trend is that people are increasingly relying on social media to obtain healthcare information and tending to believe what they read on social media. Given the serious consequences of misinformation, this study aims to explore the efficacy of a potential cure for the infodemic we face. Specifically, we focus on a countermeasure that Twitter used, which is to nudge users toward credible information when users search topics for which erroneous information is rampant. This Twitter’s policy is unique, in that the intervention is not about censorship but about redirecting users away from false information and toward facts. Our analysis uses 1,468 news articles that contain misinformation about health topics such as measles, vaccines, and cancer. Our analysis reveals that Twitter’s nudging policy reduces misinformation diffusion. After the policy introduction, a news article that contains misinformation is less likely to start a diffusion process on Twitter. In addition, tweets that contain a link to misinformation articles are less likely to be retweeted, quoted, or replied to, which leads to a significant reduction in the aggregated number of tweets each misinformation article attracts. We further uncover that the observed reduction is driven by the decrease both in original tweet posts—those that first introduce misinformation news articles to the Twitter platform—and in those resharing the misinformation, although the reduction is more significant in resharing posts. Last, we find that the effect is driven primarily by a decrease in human-like accounts that share links to unverified claims but not by a decrease in activities by bot-like accounts. Our findings suggest that a misinformation policy that relies on a nudge to a credible source rather than on censorship can suppress misinformation diffusion."
