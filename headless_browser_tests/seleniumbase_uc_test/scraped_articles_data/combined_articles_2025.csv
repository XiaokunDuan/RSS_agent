ISR,2025,Follow Your Heart or Listen to Users? The Case of Mobile App Design,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0060,"Firms strive to improve their products over time to compete effectively in the market. Typically, firms update their products by adding novel or differentiating features or by imitating competitors. With the ubiquity of social media, there is also the opportunity to obtain customer input on their preferred features for a product. In the case of mobile apps, user feedback in the form of reviews may include suggestions of novel features or those that are already present in competing apps but not in the focal app. Leveraging the information contained in reviews and version release notes of iOS apps, we develop a deep learning–based natural language processing approach to identify four types of app features: developer-initiated novel, developer-initiated imitative, user-suggested novel, and user-suggested imitative. We evaluate the impact of these feature categories on app demand. Our results demonstrate that only developer-initiated novel and user-suggested imitative features help increase app demand. We also find that the impact of user-suggested novel features is negative. However, this negative effect is limited to features that are contextually distant from user suggestions, whereas contextually close implementations have a positive effect. Although we observe that the aggregate impact of developer-initiated imitative features is statistically insignificant, features that are slightly modified from the original apps do have a positive effect on demand. The primary contribution of our study is to investigate user reviews as a source of ideas for new features and to evaluate their performance impacts relative to those of developer-initiated features."
ISR,2025,Customer Engagement Prediction on Social Media: A Graph Neural Network Method,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0281,"With the rapid prevalence and massive user growth of social media platforms, efficiently targeting potential customers on these platforms has grown in importance for companies. Enhancing the likelihood that a social media user will engage with brand posts holds profound implications for online marketing strategy design. However, predicting customer engagement on social media comes with its own set of challenges. In this work, we design a graph neural network model called the graph neural network with attention mechanism for customer engagement (GACE) to predict customer engagement (like/comment/share) of brand posts. We exploit large-scale content consumption information from the perspective of heterogeneous networks and learn latent customer representation by developing a graph neural network model. We examine GACE using a large-scale Facebook data set, and the comprehensive results show significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we conduct an interpretability analysis, which sheds some light on the explanation of the proposed model. To illustrate the practical significance of our work, we provide examples to quantify the economic value of improved predictive power using a cost-revenue analysis in the context of targeted marketing."
ISR,2025,Flow of the Game: A Hidden Markov Model of Player Engagement in Online Mobile Games,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0217,"With the rapid development of mobile technology and consumers’ increasing demand for portability, the mobile gaming market has experienced huge growth. To ensure the success of mobile games, game publishers need to keep their players engaged and, at the same time, seek monetization strategies that do not interrupt players’ engagement. This paper examines how in-game challenge-related factors (i.e., perceived challenge and fluctuation of perceived challenge) and a novel mobile game monetization strategy—reward ads—affect players’ engagement. Reward ads, a popular in-app advertising monetization model in which players can voluntarily watch an ad in exchange for a reward within the game, can help publishers generate revenue without breaking the flow of the game. We develop a Hidden Markov Model and employ detailed tap-stream data from a mobile game app to study how challenge-related factors and reward ads affect players’ dynamic engagement state evolution. First, we find that players’ perceived challenge level has a positive, but diminishing, marginal effect on players’ engagement state transitions. Second, a higher fluctuation of perceived challenge increases the probability that players move to a higher engagement state. Third, the scaffolding earned by watching reward ads can help players transition to a higher engagement level. Furthermore, we study the moderating effect of perceived challenge on reward ads, and we find that reward ads are more helpful in engaging players when the perceived challenge is higher. The findings enhance the understanding of players’ engagement with mobile games and provide design guidance for mobile game publishers."
ISR,2025,The Impact of Mobile Data Cost on Consumer Price Sensitivity: A Study of a Hotel Booking App,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0450,"The rapid advancement of mobile internet technologies, such as 4G and 5 G, has greatly enhanced the accessibility and convenience of mobile shopping. However, along with these benefits, mobile data usage has introduced a novel form of search cost in consumers’ purchasing decisions compared with Wi-Fi. This arises from the perception that mobile data are more costly because of additional charges incurred when exceeding the fixed data quota, which contributes to the increase of mental cost during the search process. To examine the influence of mobile data cost on consumer price sensitivity, we conduct empirical research utilizing hotel search data obtained from a prominent hotel booking app. Our findings reveal that consumers exhibit approximately twice the level of price sensitivity when utilizing mobile data instead of Wi-Fi, resulting in an average US$17 less in revenue per hotel booking. To assess the causal relations between mobile data cost and consumer price sensitivity, we utilize an approach similar to difference-in-differences and observe that this impact is more pronounced when consumers book hotels at the end of the month (versus the beginning of the month). We further find that consumer search effort decreases when using mobile data (versus Wi-Fi) across decision stages of the search process, supporting the mechanism that mobile data cost drives consumers into the satisficing rather than maximizing search mode. Our research offers practical implications for businesses operating in mobile shopping environments and contributes to policy development in this field."
ISR,2025,From Anonymity to Accountability: How Virtual Identity Disclosure Changes the Quantity and Quality of “Likes”,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2020.0335,"An integral component of user participation in community-based platforms is giving “likes” to content posted by others. At the same time, online social participation differs from offline social participation in that online users are often allowed to create a virtual identity unrelated to their real-world identity. The objective of this study is to identify the motivations behind users’ giving “likes” when their virtual identity (i.e., username) is hidden or shown. Specifically, we leverage a natural experiment to examine the effect of virtual identity disclosure on users’ “liking” behavior. Our identification strategy relies on an exogenous policy change in an online community-based platform, where likers’ username was not visible before but publicly shown after the change. Our results show that users “liked” fewer but higher-quality articles after the policy change, consistent with their protective self-presentation motivation. This study emphasizes the significance of virtual identity, arguing that a virtual identity devoid of real-world information should not be equated with anonymity. It also underscores the importance of protective self-presentation over acquisitive self-presentation, suggesting that research should focus not only on the actions users take but also on those they intentionally avoid taking. Furthermore, our study identifies “liking” as a key channel of self-presentation, complementing the focus on posting behaviors in the extant literature. Practically, platforms can refine their policies on virtual identity disclosure to enhance content engagement, whereas content creators should tailor their offerings to meet the self-presentation needs of their audience."
ISR,2025,Impact of the General Data Protection Regulation on the Global Mobile App Market: Digital Trade Implications of Data Protection and Privacy Regulations,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0421,"Although regional data protection and privacy regimes are often cited as major barriers to crossborder digital trade, mitigating consumer privacy concerns through regulations can potentially increase the demand for foreign digital products or services. This study presents empirical evidence on this issue by examining the impact of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on the global mobile app market. We construct a comprehensive data set of apps distributed by Apple’s App Store over the 26-month period covering the enactment of the GDPR and employ econometric models to analyze the regulation’s effects on app trade between country pairs. Contrary to assertions that regional data protection and privacy regulations impede digital trade and aggravate fragmentation, the empirical results demonstrate a significant increase in top-performing foreign apps compared with native ones in the European Union countries post-GDPR. We further conduct a series of analyses to explore the underlying mechanisms potentially driving these effects from both the supply and demand sides. Our findings lend support to the demand-side mechanism, whereby the GDPR helps alleviate consumer privacy concerns and provides reassurance in adopting foreign digital products."
ISR,2025,The Impact of Geographic and Social Proximity on Physicians: Evidence from the Adoption of an Online Health Community,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2020.0663,"Although online doctor consultations are rapidly gaining popularity, physicians must actively participate in physician–patient interaction platforms to fully unlock their potential. Through a social influence lens, this study empirically investigates physician adoption behavior over time across regions in the diffusion of an online health community (OHC). We examined the impacts of geographically and socially close adopters and investigated the interaction of proximity influences and competition in adoption. We collected panel data on 21,654 physicians in 32 cities in three provinces in China from a large Chinese OHC. The results demonstrate that both geographic and social proximity facilitate adoption when local competition is low. However, as local competition increases, the impact of socially close prior adopters increases, whereas that of geographically close prior adopters decreases. This pattern becomes stronger for physicians with lower titles."
ISR,2025,Deeper Down the Rabbit Hole: How Technology Conspiracy Beliefs Emerge and Foster a Conspiracy Mindset,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0494,"Conspiracy theories, which allege that powerful groups hatch malicious plots, are increasingly recognized as a threat to contemporary society. Although research acknowledges the role of information technology (IT) in spreading such theories, the understanding of conspiracy beliefs related to technology, their formation, and their effects remains limited. Building on theoretical insights on conspiracy beliefs and information systems (IS) research dealing with the impact of individuals’ perceptions of technology, we theorize on technology conspiracy beliefs. We define technology conspiracy beliefs as an individual’s endorsement of an unverified narrative that purports that an organization issuing technology is using that technology to secretly pursue evil goals. We then develop the TECONMIND (technology-conspiracy-mindset) model, which suggests that an individual’s perceptions of a technology’s characteristics (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and perceived risks) and its issuer’s characteristics (perceived malevolence and perceived power) can lead to the formation of technology conspiracy beliefs. Moreover, the model proposes a reciprocal relationship between technology conspiracy beliefs and a broader conspiracy mindset. Accordingly, we expect technology conspiracy beliefs to foster a conspiracy mindset, which in turn, promotes further technology conspiracy beliefs. We provide empirical evidence for the prevalence of technology conspiracy beliefs and then test this model in two studies—a multiwave field study and an experiment—that support our central propositions. Our study contributes to IS research in three ways. First, by developing a conceptual understanding of technology conspiracy beliefs, we introduce an IT artifact-centered concept that allows researchers to explore a previously overlooked dark side of technology. Second, we establish a reciprocal relationship between technology conspiracy beliefs and conspiracy mindsets, indicating that the endorsement of technology conspiracy beliefs can set in motion a vicious cycle in which individuals increasingly interpret their environment using conspiracy theories. Third, we provide an initial understanding of which perceived technology and issuer characteristics make technologies prone to become objects of conspiracy beliefs. Our findings should sensitize technology developers and policymakers as to how their decisions can instigate or mitigate technology conspiracy beliefs, which have significant long-term societal consequences."
ISR,2025,Monitoring and Home Bias in Global Hiring: Evidence from an Online Labor Platform,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0526,"The increasing prevalence of remote work has accelerated the adoption of monitoring systems to keep track of worker behavior, especially on online labor platforms. In contrast to the existing literature that predominantly focuses on the effect of monitoring on productivity, this study investigates the impact of monitoring from the perspective of contractual governance. In principle, by enabling the detailed real-time observation of worker progress, the deployment of monitoring systems has the potential to improve contractual control and coordination, thereby reducing employers’ preferences for domestic workers (home bias). Leveraging the exogenous introduction of a monitoring system for time-based projects on a leading online labor platform, we employ a difference-in-differences model to estimate the impact of monitoring systems in reducing home bias. Our findings reveal that following the monitoring system’s introduction, the bias against foreign workers becomes substantially weaker and statistically insignificant, highlighting the overlooked role of monitoring systems in fostering a more level playing field for global workers. Our further analysis indicates that monitoring leads to a notable 15% increase in the hiring of foreign workers. Moreover, the decrease in home bias is more pronounced in high-routine projects or when employers lack prior positive experiences with foreign workers, two scenarios characterized by low external uncertainty and high internal uncertainty, respectively. Additionally, employers no longer exhibit a stronger home bias when workers have higher ratings, where the expected moral hazard risk is lower, nor when workers reside in the same time zone, where expected coordination costs are lower. These findings lend support to the effectiveness of monitoring systems in mitigating employers’ home bias through enhancing contractual control and coordination. Our findings provide important managerial implications for the design of online labor platforms."
ISR,2025,Learning Personalized Privacy Preference from Public Data,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0318,"Learning consumers’ personalized privacy preferences is crucial for firms and policymakers to establish trust and compliance and guide effective policymaking. Existing approaches rely mostly on private information such as proprietary user behavior data and individual-level demographic and socio-economic factors, or require explicit user input, which can be invasive and burdensome, potentially leading to user dissatisfaction. Nowadays, individuals generate and share vast amounts of information about themselves in the public domain, which can provide a valuable multifaceted view of their behaviors, attitudes, and preferences. This information thus has the potential to provide valuable insights into individuals’ privacy preferences. In this study, we propose a novel framework to predict personalized privacy preference by leveraging a ubiquitous source of public data—social media posts. Deeply rooted in psychological and privacy theories, we use deep learning model and natural language processing algorithms to learn theory-driven psychosocial traits such as lifestyle, risk preference, personality, privacy-related economic preferences, linguistic styles, and more from social media posts. Interestingly, we find that psychosocial traits from public data provide greater predictive power than private information. Furthermore, we conduct multiple interpretability analyses to understand what drives the model’s performance. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of our model and show that our framework can assist platforms and policymakers in forecasting the consequences of privacy policies. Overall, our framework provides managerial implications for enhancing consumer privacy control and trust, optimizing platform data management, and informing policymakers about better data privacy regulations."
ISR,2025,Time to Stop? An Empirical Investigation on the Consequences of Canceling Monetary Incentives on a Digital Platform,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0017,"Digital platforms commonly use monetary incentives to motivate users to perform specific tasks. Extant studies have shown the effects of introducing such monetary rewards on the outcomes of interest (e.g., participation and performance) on public platforms. However, little is known about the impact of canceling rewards (i.e., whether it simply reverses the effect of their introduction), and particularly less attention is paid to corporate platforms. Our study examines the impact of canceling monetary incentives using quasi-natural experiments on a corporate platform. Similar to prior studies focusing on public platforms, we find that introducing quantity-based monetary incentives increases participation (contribution quantity), but has no significant effect on performance (contribution quality). Yet, in contrast, our main empirical analysis reveals that canceling monetary incentives is not simply the reverse process of their introduction. In particular, compared with the increase in participation when monetary rewards were initially introduced, the cancellation of these rewards leads to a sharper decrease in participation. This suggests that canceling rewards has a net negative impact on participation. In addition, canceling monetary rewards also causes a significant decline in performance, which indicates that the effects of canceling and introducing rewards on performance are not simply the opposite of each other. Furthermore, we examine the heterogeneous responses of individuals with different self-motivation types and working competency levels to monetary incentives, highlighting the “asymmetry” between canceling and introducing incentives. We also discuss the similarities and differences between corporate and public platforms regarding the impact of monetary incentives. Our results provide important practical implications for enterprise information systems and general information systems regarding their design of platform strategies."
ISR,2025,Navigating Platform-Led Affiliate Marketing: Implications for Content Creation and Platform Profitability,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0620,"Recently, some user-generated content (UGC) platforms have introduced shopping features to generate additional commission-based revenue from in-app transactions. These platforms allow creators to produce shoppable content, where promoted products are tagged with affiliate links, and in return, they earn a percentage of the commission the creators receive from merchants (such a new business model is referred to asplatform-led affiliate marketing). Despite its growing popularity, the impact of this business model on the key stakeholders (i.e., UGC platforms, content creators, and content consumers) has yet to be systematically analyzed in the existing literature. This paper aims to address this significant literature gap by employing a game-theoretic model. Our findings demonstrate that platform-led affiliate marketing can create a win-win situation for UGC platforms, creators participating in affiliate marketing, and content consumers. Furthermore, we find that even creators not participating in affiliate marketing can sometimes benefit indirectly from other creators’ participation. On the other hand, surprisingly, we find that UGC platforms may not necessarily benefit from adopting this emerging business model because of potential losses in traffic revenue. These results carry significant managerial implications for UGC platforms regarding whether and how to leverage affiliate marketing. Moreover, our findings suggest that creators may benefit from reducing their production efforts in the face of intensified competition. More importantly, optimal production decisions for creators can vary significantly, depending on specific factors (e.g., an increase in the number of creators or content substitutability) contributing to heightened competition. These findings offer valuable insights that can guide creators in refining their production strategies."
ISR,2025,"Mobile Apps, Trading Behaviors, and Portfolio Performance: Evidence from a Quasi-Experiment in China",https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2020.0616,"Mobile apps are among the most important and widely used financial technology (fintech) innovations in the brokerage industry. Surprisingly, despite their increasing economic importance and theoretical significance, few studies examine the effects of mobile app use on individual investors’ financial decisions and performance. This study seeks to understand how mobile apps influence investors’ trading behaviors and portfolio performance by using a proprietary longitudinal data set from December 2012 to November 2015 from a large securities company in China with a quasi-experimental setting to answer our research questions. We leverage the introduction of an app to identify the effect of mobile app adoption by using a sample of 20,665 investors. We use the generalized synthetic control method and find that mobile app adoption does not affect investors’ portfolio performance when one examines aggregate impacts using a binary indicator of mobile app use. Our analyses of the mechanisms indicate that adopting mobile apps results in a noticeable decrease in time constraints, a proxy for transaction friction, and a modest increase intrend-chasing bias, reflecting tendencies toward myopic decision making. Because the reduction in time constraints can benefit investors’ performance, the increase in trend-chasing can be detrimental to investors’ performance; our findings explain why mobile app adoption has no overall effect on portfolio performance. Further analyses of adopters’ postadoption behaviors provide interesting insights and show that the mobile app usage intensity has an inverted U–shaped relationship with portfolio performance. The results are robust to using different samples or excluding high market volatility periods and by using a variety of methods, such as propensity score matching, dynamic matching, stacked difference in differences, or an instrumental variable approach. We discuss the implications for research and practice."
ISR,2025,Clocking in or Not? Optimal Design of a Novel Gamified Business Model in Online Learning,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0138,"Clocking-in cash-back (CIC), an emerging gamified business model in online learning, has recently garnered significant attention. CIC allows users to secure a full refund of the course fee through consecutive completion of specific tasks within a required time window. These tasks, known asclocking in, encompass activities such as daily assignments and sharing progress updates on social media. By employing this gamification system, the firm effectively monitors user efforts, categorizing them as winners or quitters based on clocking-in completion. Despite its growing popularity, this new business model has yet to be systematically analyzed in the literature. This paper fills this critical gap by examining how an online learning firm should set the optimal time window for its course and how the time window is affected by context-specific factors. We identify two opposing effects associated with extending the time window on users’ quitting time: thepsychological-disutility increasingeffect (negative) and theeffort-cost decreasingeffect (positive). Our results indicate that as quitters’ positiveword-of-mouth(WOM) effects increase, there are cases in which the firm should opt for shortening the time window, primarily because of the psychological-disutility increasing effect outweighing the effort-cost decreasing effect. Furthermore, we find that it is not always beneficial for the firm to extend the time window when there is an increased presence of high-ability users. Additionally, we find that as the marginal content creation cost rises, instead of reducing the difficulty level of each task, the firm may find it more advantageous to raise the difficulty level by shortening the time window. Our findings provide valuable insights that online learning firms can utilize to enhance their design of the CIC mechanism."
ISR,2025,HyperCARS: Using Hyperbolic Embeddings for Generating Hierarchical Contextual Situations in Context-Aware Recommender Systems,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0202,"Contextual situations, such as having dinner at a restaurant on Friday with the spouse, became a useful mechanism to represent context in context-aware recommender systems (CARS). Prior research has shown important advantages of using latent embedding representation approaches to model contextual information in the Euclidean space leading to better recommendations. However, these traditional approaches have major challenges with construction of proper embeddings of hierarchical structures of contextual information, as well as with interpretations of the obtained representations that would be useful for managers. To address these problems, we propose the HyperCARS method that models hierarchical contextual situations in the latent hyperbolic space. HyperCARS combines hyperbolic embeddings with hierarchical clustering to construct contextual situations, which allows to loosely couple the contextual modeling component with recommendation algorithms and therefore provides flexibility to use a broad range of previously developed recommendation algorithms. We demonstrate empirically that the proposed hyperbolic embedding approach better captures the hierarchical nature of context than its Euclidean counterpart and produces hierarchical contextual situations that are more distinct and better separated at multiple hierarchical levels. We also demonstrate that hyperbolic contextual situations lead to better context-aware recommendations in terms of standard recommendation metrics and to better interpretability of the resulting hierarchical contextual situations. Because hyperbolic embeddings can also be used in many other applications besides CARS, in this paper, we propose the latent embeddings representation framework that systematically classifies prior work on embeddings and identifies novel research streams for hyperbolic embeddings across information systems applications."
ISR,2025,Stress from Digital Work: Toward a Unified View of Digital Hindrance Stressors,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0691,"There are many models with various sets of hindrance technostressors. Researchers and practitioners face the challenge of selecting a model or mixing several models without guidance on their relative advantages and suitability for contemporary digital work. None of the existing models captures the full conceptual breadth of hindrance technostress, and the existing models typically offer suboptimal power to explain the negative psychological responses or outcomes of technostressors. We synthesize the fragmented works on hindrance technostressors and propose a unified hierarchical model of digital hindrance stressors. We provide an extensive and parsimonious measurement model with high predictive power. This work builds on technostress and occupational stress theory using a quantitative-dominant mixed-methods study. The empirical part of the study includes a qualitative prestudy and multiple surveys with more than 5,800 participants. The data support the modeling, validation, and benchmarking of the new models we introduce. We discuss the relative advantages of the models for research and practice and guide their selection."
ISR,2025,Dynamics of Shared Security in the Cloud,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0256,"Cloud services exist under a shared security environment with a dynamic nature; users trade fixed costs for variable costs over time, and both cloud services providers (CSPs) and users contribute to overall security. We investigate the nature of shared security in a dynamic game where users’ security contributions and cloud usage figure into their CSP’s vulnerability. Furthermore, CSPs’ own security contribution takes into account both their users as well as competition with other CSPs. The Markov perfect equilibrium reveals the long-term time patterns of security of the cloud. In particular, we identify a novel form of time-path strategic complementary between usage and a CSP’s Markov state of security. This implies that cloud security is an unusual form of impure public good, whereby individual contributions bolstering a CSP’s security endow a selective incentive (private benefit) on others rather than on the contributor alone. Because this increases usage, CSP vulnerability increases over time. At the same time, CSP competition on security may lead to both welfare improvements for users and lock-in."
ISR,2025,Beyond Risk: A Measure of Distribution Uncertainty,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0089,"Uncertainty, particularly distribution uncertainty (a.k.a. ambiguity), holds significant relevance in both academic research and practical applications. Much of the existing research, however, has concentrated primarily on addressing outcome uncertainty (or risk), frequently neglecting the aspect of distribution uncertainty. This research delves into distribution uncertainty, a critical yet often overlooked aspect of empirical research. We argue that there is a pressing need to integrate considerations of ambiguity directly into the development and implementation of data analytics models, calling for the promotion and wider use of a well-defined measure of ambiguity. We introduce a quantitative measure of ambiguity that surpasses conventional approaches by precisely capturing distribution uncertainty. We illustrate the properties and advantages of this measure, highlighting its ability to enhance empirical models, yield more reliable parameter estimates, and contribute to the decision-making process. Using decision making in the financial market as an example, we demonstrate the value of this ambiguity measure. This paper promotes a more nuanced understanding of uncertainty and offers implications for both research methodologies and practical risk management."
ISR,2025,Unveiling the Cost of Free: How an Ad-Sponsored Model Affects Serialized Digital Content Creation,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0263,"The selection of a business model significantly impacts the success of digital content platforms, influencing both consumers and creators. Within the field of serialized digital content, establishing incentives that align with creators’ interests poses a notable challenge. Web novel platforms, which allow writers to produce and market their work online, have traditionally adopted a pay-per-view model, where readers pay for access to content. However, a recent trend has seen the introduction of an ad-sponsored model, aimed at attracting readers with free content. Although the ad-sponsored model expands reader accessibility, its effects on writers remain uncertain. Our study investigates the impacts of the ad-sponsored model on writers’ content creation efforts, leveraging a policy change within a leading web novel platform as a natural experiment. Our results indicate a general decrease in writers’ productivity under the ad-sponsored model. To uncover the underlying mechanism, we focus on the role of reader engagement and conduct a mediation analysis. Our results demonstrate that the ad-sponsored model is associated with less reader engagement, which leads to a subsequent decrease in writers’ content creation efforts. Further, we conduct a reader-level analysis and find a significant decline in engagement with writers among those who consume ad-sponsored content, providing additional evidence supporting our main findings. These results substantiate our hypothesis that diminished reader engagement stems from a perception of reduced “sunk costs” associated with free, ad-sponsored content compared with paid books. From a psychological standpoint, the sunk costs inherent in paid content motivate continued reader engagement and interaction with writers, whereas ad-sponsored reading removes such costs, thereby decreasing reader engagement. This study holds profound implications for digital content platforms, underscoring the necessity for platform managers to carefully evaluate the impacts of implementing the ad-sponsored model on both creators and consumers of serialized digital content."
ISR,2025,The Impact of Situational Achievement Goals on Online Learning Behavior: Results from Field Experiments,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0353,"Despite their prevalence, online learning platforms have difficulty sustaining user motivation, resulting in low engagement and poor performance. Addressing this challenge, we study how these platforms can boost learner motivation by fostering an effective learning environment and inducing different situational goals. We conducted a randomized field experiment with behavioral interventions inspired by the achievement goal theory in a massive open online course with more than 2,000 learners from 171 countries. Using various econometric analyses, we estimate the effects of interventions based on three situational achievement goals: learning, performance-prove, and performance-avoidance. In contrast to the traditional (offline) education literature, which finds learning goals to be the most effective and performance goals to be inferior, we demonstrate that performance-prove goals are the most effective in enhancing online engagement and performance. We trace the roots of this finding to the differences in the structure of online and offline environments and the psychological needs of online learners. We uncover the underlying mechanism by empirically examining how situational achievement goals stimulate different achievement emotions necessary to maintain engagement in the learning process. We further find that the effectiveness of each goal depends on learners’ characteristics: prior performance and social activity. Learners with stronger prior performance benefit more from the performance-prove goal, whereas those with moderate performance levels gain from the performance-avoidance goal, and those with lower prior performance are positively influenced by the learning goal. Socially isolated learners respond best to performance goals. Through a second field experiment, we explore the optimal combination of situational goals. We find that combining learning and performance-prove goals leads to the highest learning outcomes. Our study offers theoretical contributions and practical implications for scholars and platform providers on how to effectively leverage situational achievement goals and related achievement emotions for improving online user outcomes."
ISR,2025,Does Virtual Reality Help Property Sales? Empirical Evidence from a Real Estate Platform,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.9138,"Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a transformative addition to real estate platforms, revolutionizing the presentation of property details. In contrast to traditional presentation technologies (e.g., pictures and videos), VR constructs an interactive three-dimensional (3D) environment for consumers to obtain property information. Prior literature mainly examined VR’s effects (e.g., vividness and interactivity) on selling low-involvement products such as books and apparel from a behavioral perspective. Real estate properties are typical high-involvement products, differing significantly in product value, importance, risk, and agent participation, necessitating comprehensive product information. We use a large-scale data set from a leading real estate platform to investigate VR’s influences on properties’ market outcomes (including the time-on-market and selling price) from an informative perspective. We find that VR is an “efficiency enhancer,” accelerating properties’ time-on-market rather than increasing properties’ selling price as a “market value influencer.” VR shows a greater acceleration effect for properties with higher product involvement, higher product quality, and lower agent service quality. This demonstrates VR’s ability in enhancing information richness to satisfy consumers’ information needs for a higher level of product involvement; establishing information credibility in discerning product quality; and serving as an alternative information source in lieu of low-quality agent services. We also disentangle the direct effect of VR Tour from the indirect effect of VR badge on consumers’ decision making to reveal VR’s effectiveness in product evaluation. This work contributes to the literature on nonimmersive VR and offers managerial implications, particularly in the context of property sales, high-involvement product marketing, and product presentation technologies in e-commerce."
ISR,2025,How to Make My Bug Bounty Cost-Effective? A Game-Theoretical Model,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0349,"To mitigate the threats from malicious exploitation of vulnerabilities, an increasing number of organizations across different industries have started incorporating bug bounty programs (BBPs) in their vulnerability management cycles. Whereas a BBP attracts external security researchers to facilitate the discovery of vulnerabilities in organizations’ information technology systems, it also increases the risks after the vulnerabilities are discovered. To deal with the trade-offs, organizations need to understand how to design an optimal bounty and evaluate the total cost of a BBP depending on several key factors. The industry is motivated to understand how the bounty and total costs are impacted by (i) the characteristics of the organization (e.g., security posture and patching complexity), (ii) security researchers (e.g., the heterogeneity among security researchers and their number), and (iii) other factors such as the legal framework surrounding the BBP. However, because there is a lack of formal analyses regarding these issues, we use game-theoretical models to shed light on relevant questions and provide several useful results and managerial insights. First, although an organization’s patching complexity and the bounty act as substitutes, the relationship between security posture and the bounty is not necessarily substitutive or complementary. Furthermore, having a larger number of or more capable security researchers does not necessarily imply an increased bounty or lower total costs. Moreover, whereas the prevalent business belief is that an increased level of legal protection offered to the security researchers increases the cost of the BBP, we find that neither the cost of the BBP nor the offered bounty necessarily increases or decreases. This nuanced finding depends on different types of costs incurred because of the inherent vulnerability itself and costs related to possible leaks out of the BBP.

Impact of Rival’s Expertise Signals on Online User Engagement,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0282,"How does information on a rival’s expertise influence the focal user’s engagement in online competitive settings? Online competitive settings differ fundamentally from other online contexts, such as e-commerce and social media platforms, explored in the prior work. This contextual distinction, we argue, is important as it determines the relationship between information about others and the focal user’s engagement. The relevance of this question relates to broader theoretical ambiguities concerning the effects of status and past performance as relative and absolute signals of expertise. Our findings are based on a field experiment in which we modified the multiround mobile two-player gaming app interface, randomly exposing players to rival’s status and past performance signals. We measure the focal user’s engagement regarding their decision to continue the game after each round. As a baseline, we find that the focal user is less likely to continue the game if the rival exhibits higher current performance. However, the rival’s status and past performance signals create strong contingencies wherein the principle effect of current performance is stronger if the rival has a high status or moderate past performance. Further, these contingent effects are partly predicated on the focal player’s motivation to compete. These findings offer several important implications for driving user engagement in online competitive settings and meaningfully advance our current understanding of the effects of status and past performance information on online engagement."
ISR,2025,Platform Governance with Algorithm-Based Content Moderation: An Empirical Study on Reddit,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0036,"With increasing volumes of participation in social media and online communities, content moderation has become an integral component of platform governance. Volunteer (human) moderators have thus far been the essential workforce for content moderation. Because volunteer-based content moderation faces challenges in achieving scalable, desirable, and sustainable moderation, many online platforms have recently started to adopt algorithm-based content moderation tools (bots). When bots are introduced into platform governance, it is unclear how volunteer moderators react in terms of their community-policing and -nurturing efforts. To understand the impacts of these increasingly popular bot moderators, we conduct an empirical study with data collected from 156 communities (subreddits) on Reddit. Based on a series of econometric analyses, we find that bots augment volunteer moderators by stimulating them to moderate a larger quantity of posts, and such effects are pronounced in larger communities. Specifically, volunteer moderators perform 20.9% more community policing, particularly over subjective rules. Moreover, in communities with larger sizes, volunteers also exert increased efforts in offering more explanations and suggestions after their community adopted bots. Notably, increases in activities are primarily driven by the increased need for nurturing efforts to accompany growth in subjective policing. Moreover, introducing bots to content moderation also improves the retention of volunteer moderators. Overall, we show that introducing algorithm-based content moderation into platform governance is beneficial for sustaining digital communities."
ISR,2025,"Less Artificial, More Intelligent: Understanding Affinity, Trustworthiness, and Preference for Digital Humans",https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0203,"Companies are beginning to deploy highly realistic-looking digital human agents (DHAs) controlled by increasingly realistic artificial intelligence (AI) for online customer service tasks often performed by chatbots. We conducted four major experiments to examine users’ perceptions (trustworthiness, affinity, and willingness to work with) and behaviors while using DHA via a mixed-method approach with data from quantitative surveys, qualitative interviews, direct observations, and neurophysiological measurements. Four different DHAs were used in our experiments, which included commercial products from two different vendors (which proved to be immature) and two future-focused ones (where participants were successfully led to believe that the human-controlled digital human was controlled by AI). The first study compared user perceptions of a DHA, a chatbot, and a human agent from a written description and found few differences between the DHA and the chatbot. The second study compared perceptions after using a commercially available DHA and a chatbot. Most participants reported problems using acurrentproduction implementation of DHA, either finding it uncanny or robotic or having trouble conversing with it. The third and fourth studies used a plausiblefuture-focused“Wizard of Oz” design by informing users that the DHA was controlled by AI when it was actually controlled by a human. Participants still preferred a human agent using video conferencing to the DHA, but after controlling for visual fidelity, we did not find evidence of differences between the human and the DHA. Current DHAs that have communication problems trigger greater affinity than chatbots but are otherwise similar to them. When the DHAs’ representation and communication ability match human ability, we failed to find differences between DHAs and human agents for simple customer service tasks. Our results also add to research on algorithm aversion and suggest that the anthropomorphic computer interfaces of DHA might alleviate algorithm aversion."
ISR,2025,Omnificence or Differentiation? An Empirical Study of Knowledge Structure and Career Development of IT Workers,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0634,"Amid the growing importance of information technology (IT) in the business landscape, the pivotal role of IT knowledge on the demand side of the labor market, at both industry and firm levels, is well documented. However, the important labor supply side concerning IT workers has remained largely unknown. This raises challenges about how IT professionals should strategically cultivate their IT knowledge structures toward a sustainable, well-compensated career path. This paper bridges this gap by examining how different types of IT knowledge structures of IT workers impact their salaries and job security over time. We theorize, define, and operationalize two new metrics to characterize the knowledge structures of an IT worker.Knowledge omnificencemeasures the breadth of an IT worker’s own knowledge structure, whereasknowledge differentiationassesses the extent of difference between one’s knowledge set and those of their peers. By analyzing extensive career data of IT workers from 2000 to 2016, we demonstrated that, on average, a high level of IT knowledge differentiation or omnificence yields positive economic returns for IT workers. However, there is an intriguing twist: such a positive relationship is not monotonic. The most advantageous strategy is to acquire IT knowledge at moderate levels of knowledge omnificence and differentiation. Further, our results revealed another new twist: to increase salary potential or pursue a better position, one should aim for knowledge omnificence, whereas those valuing job security should aim for knowledge differentiation. This aligns with our theoretical rationale that utilizes a structured framework, integrating the dynamic capability framework and the boundaryless career theory. Besides, we found that both knowledge omnificence and differentiation reduced gender disparity in the labor market. In particular, females benefited more, with a 14.74% (or 1.38%) increase in salary, from having a one-unit increase in knowledge omnificence (or differentiation). This study holds critical managerial implications for IT workers, firms, and policymakers. It emphasizes the importance of strategic management of IT knowledge structure in enabling IT workers to thrive in the dynamic and competitive IT job market."
ISR,2025,The Effect of Voice AI on Digital Commerce,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0140,"Voice-activated shopping assistants (voice AI), such as Amazon Alexa and Alibaba Tmall Genie, have been gaining popularity worldwide as a new channel for online shopping. In this paper, we analyze large-scale archival data of consumer-level purchase records from Alibaba, the world’s largest e-commerce platform, to empirically investigate how consumers’ adoption of Tmall Genie affects their consumption. The results show that the average consumer’s weekly spending the e-commerce platform increased by 16.6% within the first four months after adopting voice AI. Additionally, we explore specific product features that moderate the effect of Genie adoption by examining repeat purchases, product substitutability, and familiarity, supporting a mechanism that involves reducing information acquisition costs. The positive effects of Genie adoption remain significant on repeat purchases in the long term, although they attenuate over time. Furthermore, our analyses reveal that on average, the voice channel has a positive spillover effect on spending on the PC channel but no significant effect on the mobile channel. The channel dynamics are contingent on specific shopping contexts. Our results demonstrate that voice AI devices with shopping capabilities can enhance the growth of the affiliated e-commerce platform. As the first study to empirically examine the impact of voice AI adoption on e-commerce consumption, our paper provides valuable implications for e-commerce platforms and retailers leveraging voice-activated shopping."
ISR,2025,The Effect of Popularity Cues and Peer Endorsements on Assertive Social Media Ads,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0606,"Social media platforms, such as Facebook, often display assertive call-to- action ads that encourage direct conversion actions, such as purchasing a product or installing an app. Additionally, these ads can display popularity signals (i.e., “likes”) and social endorsement from friends (i.e., friends’ “likes”). We examine the effectiveness of displaying these different signals on such ads in generating clicks through field tests conducted on Facebook. We collaborated with a mobile app company and conducted a call-to-action ad campaign on Facebook, targeting unique user groups with this type of ads for a mobile app. Our findings reveal that the overall number of “likes” associated with the ad does not impact the user’s decision to click the ad. Additionally, ads endorsed by friends have a lower clicking performance compared with those without such endorsement. Further analyses based on randomized laboratory studies and additional field tests using different products and apps confirm these results and demonstrate that the presence of these cues activates users’ persuasion knowledge of assertive call-to-action ads, resulting in a lower click performance. Furthermore, the negative impact of social cues is particularly pronounced when there is low similarity between users and their friends. These results have significant implications for the design of assertive call-to-action ads on social media platforms."
ISR,2025,Promoting Security Behaviors in Remote Work Environments: Personal Values Shaping Information Security Policy Compliance,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0563,"Cybersecurity threats and information security policy (ISP) compliance are critical concerns for organizations. The recent trend of working from home has made individual characteristics more relevant in fostering ISP compliance. Whereas extant research has theorized and offered alternatives to induce ISP compliance, most studies have failed to consider the differences between onsite and remote workers to motivate compliance with ISPs and have instead focused on standard interventions without considering personal characteristics. One of the few models including factors related to individuals’ characteristics is the unified model of information security policy compliance (UMISPC). This paper extends the UMISPC by drawing on Schwartz’s universal theory of personal values. We propose the values construct as a robust representation of an individual’s motivations to comply with an ISP. We confirm that personal values are significant predictors of compliance with ISPs. Furthermore, a comparison between onsite and remote workers suggests that personal values are more relevant in remote work settings. Our findings shed light on the values and individual characteristics that are important motivators for ISP compliance and how they differ for onsite and remote workers. Our results suggest that people’s personal motivations should be considered in promoting organizations’ ISPs and that organizations’ interventions should be tailored by understanding what values motivate or hinder ISP compliance."
ISR,2025,Understanding the Dynamic and Episodic Nature of Technostressors and Their Effects on Cyberdeviance: A Daily Field Investigation,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2020.0273,"Technostress is an emerging topic in the information systems (IS) literature. Prior studies have mostly adopted a static approach to capturing snapshots of technostressors, without considering their dynamic and episodic nature. Daily technostress is often the product of discrete events encountered in the workplace that shape employees’ momentary affect and behaviors in situ. To lay the conceptual foundation for understanding deviant behaviors, this study integrates the self-regulation perspective into the transactional model of stress and conducts a contextualized, longitudinal, and daily investigation of how and when daily perceived technostressors affect employees’ daily cyberdeviant behaviors (i.e., cyberdeviance). In a time-lagged experience sampling study of 188 professionals who completed a survey three times a day for two weeks, we found that employees experiencing daily techno-overload and techno-invasion are likely to engage in daily cyberdeviance to cope with their daily exhaustion. We also examined the cross-level moderating effect of an individual trait (i.e., technology self-efficacy) on the strength of the within-person process model of daily cyberdeviance. Our multilevel analysis results showed that technology self-efficacy alleviated employees’ daily exhaustion induced by daily techno-overload. This study theoretically contributes to the IS literature by providing a theoretical explanation of the underlying mechanisms of techno-overload, techno-invasion, and employees’ cyberdeviance, in addition to using a within-person approach to understand the dynamic and episodic nature of these technostressors."
ISR,2025,Better Is Better? Signaling Paradoxes in Performance-Based Advertising,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0419,"Advertising signaling theory shows that costly advertising can serve as a credible signal of product quality (hereafterad-signal), provided that the effectiveness of advertising can be accurately measured. The rise of performance-based advertising, in which advertising is paid based on consumer actions, such as clicking on or purchasing through an ad link, presents challenges in measuring the effectiveness of advertising. Specifically, it becomes difficult to differentiate whether a consumer’s action is caused by ad-signal or the inherent product appeal. This leads to a critical question: how does this inaccuracy in evaluating advertising effectiveness affect the signaling role of advertising? This research analyzes how the inherent product reputation and the breadth of ad-signal reach impact the signaling role of advertising, uncovering two paradoxes under performance-based advertising: a higher product reputation does not necessarily help advertising to signal product quality (product reputation paradox), and a broader ad-signal reach can impede the signaling role of advertising (ad-signal reach paradox). We propose modified payment schemes to address both paradoxes. These insights contribute to advertising signaling theory and offer practical guidance for designing effective payment schemes under performance-based advertising."
ISR,2025,Opening First-Party App Resources: Empirical Evidence of Free-Riding,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0607,"Platform owners are releasing their own apps on their platforms. These first-party apps (FPAs) typically leverage platform resources more effectively, competitively threatening rivals. Although the impact of FPAs on rivals’ innovation has been the subject of extensive study, the dominant view in previous research assumes that these FPAs are closed to third-party apps (TPAs). However, there is an increasing trend of FPAs opening their resources to TPAs, as they provide application programming interfaces (APIs) allowing TPAs to access their resources. Rivals still exist, as many TPAs choose not to have access to FPAs’ open resources because of their limited control over these resources. Does opening an FPA’s resources impact rivals’ innovation? The answer to the question is largely unknown. We exploit the release of the Apple Health Records API, a feature that opens Apple Health Records to TPAs, to design a quasi-experiment that investigates whether and how opening an FPA’s resources influence rivals’ innovations. Through several analyses, we conclude that opening an FPA’s resources to TPAs generates free-riding benefits for rivals. Moreover, these benefits mainly arise because of the growing presence of TPAs that do not adopt FPAs’ open resources in the market. We discuss the theoretical contributions and practical implications of our findings."
ISR,2025,"Timely Quality Problem Resolution in Peer-Production Systems: The Impact of Bots, Policy Citations, and Contributor Experience",https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2020.0485,"Although online peer-production systems have proven to be effective in producing high-quality content, their open call for participation makes them susceptible to ongoing quality problems. A key concern is that the problems should be addressed quickly to prevent low-quality content from remaining in place for extended periods. We examine the impacts of two control mechanisms, bots and policy citations, and the number of contributors, with and without prior experience in editing an article, on the cleanup time of 4,473 quality problem events in Wikipedia. We definecleanup timeas the time it takes to resolve a quality problem once it has been detected in an article. Using an accelerated failure time model, we find that the number of bots editing an article during a quality problem event has no effect on cleanup time; that citing policies to justify edits during the event is associated with a longer cleanup time; and that more contributors, with or without prior experience in editing the article, are associated with a shorter cleanup time. We also find important interactions between each of the two control mechanisms and the number of different types of contributors. There is a marginal increase in cleanup time that is larger when an increase in the number of contributors is accompanied by fewer bots editing the article during a quality problem event. This interaction effect is more pronounced when increasing the number of contributors without prior experience in editing the article. Further, there is a marginal decrease in cleanup time that is larger when an increase in the number of contributors, with or without prior experience in editing the article, is accompanied by fewer policy citations. Taken together, our results show that the use of bots and policy citations as control mechanisms must be considered in conjunction with the number of contributors with and without prior experience in editing an article. Accordingly, the number of contributors and their experience alone may not explain important outcomes in peer production; it is also important to find an appropriate mix of different control mechanisms and types of contributors to address quality problems quickly."
ISR,2025,Mispricing and Algorithm Trading,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0570,"The widespread adoption of information technology has fundamentally transformed the way information is processed in the financial market. One such technological advancement is algorithm trading, which allows traders to develop sophisticated strategies based on historical price data. This raises important questions: Do these algorithm trading strategies contribute to market instability? When do they yield profits for different market participants? To address these questions, we must move beyond the efficient market hypothesis, as this theory would suggest that such strategies yield no profit due to market efficiency. Instead, we explicitly incorporate initial market mispricing into our analysis and develop a stylized continuous-time model of algorithm feedback trading to investigate market outcomes. Our model yields closed-form solutions, enabling us to assess the degree to which the price diverges from the efficient level. We discover that algorithmic trading, when combined with initial market mispricing, can lead to significant market volatility, resulting in financial bubbles and crashes. However, this scenario only occurs when there is overpricing and the algorithm traders collectively employ a strategy that enlarges the mispricing. Depending on the initial mispricing in the form of underpricing or overpricing, different algorithm trading strategies (positive or negative) have different market impact, profitability, and policy implications."
ISR,2025,Making Lemonade from Lemons: A Transaction Cost Economics Perspective on Third-Party Disruptions in a Multivendor Information Technology Service,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0033,"In modern enterprise computing environments, multiple information technology (IT) services from first and third parties are often integrated to form coherent solutions for business customers. Using transaction cost economics (TCE) as a theoretical foundation, we seek to understand how uncertainties introduced by third-party services shape enterprise customers’ use of various IT services in these multivendor service settings. Specifically, we analyze a case of service disruption caused by a third party that affects the multivendor service but does not directly affect the first-party services. In line with the tenets of TCE, we find a temporary increase in the use of first-party services that can serve as a similar-goal substitute to fulfill the organization’s needs during the disruption; however, on average, we observe a net decline in the total use of services in the long run. We empirically analyze the role of first-party technical support during the disruption. Based on textual data from the first party’s technical support log, we use deep learning to assess what actions the first party can take during such disruptions to turn the challenge into an opportunity. We find that if the first party offers high-quality technical support that specifically addresses issues related to its product, it may be able to make lemonade out of lemons. Such technical support effectively boosts customers’ use of first-party services in the long run. Curiously, however, similar efforts by the first party in the predisruption period are ineffective in achieving the same effect."
ISR,2025,Strategic Content Generation and Monetization in Financial Social Media,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0482,"Financial social media platforms, which rely on social media analysts (SMAs) to contribute content to investors, have emerged as a crucial channel for investors to gain access to financial information and for SMAs to monetize their content. However, we still have a limited understanding of the factors that affect how content is generated and monetized in financial social media platforms. This study focuses on the novel role of investors’ preferences for free/paid content and its sentiment and investigates the extent to which SMAs exhibit strategic content generation and monetization behaviors by catering to and trading off the investors’ preferences. We also evaluate the underlying mechanisms and implications of such strategic behaviors. Utilizing a data set from a financial social media platform based in China, we propose a Bayesian empirical model to jointly analyze the investor’s demand and SMAs’ strategic supply of financial social media content. The model estimation results show that SMAs cater to investors’, especially paid subscribers’, preferences in their content generation such that their strategic behaviors account for 46.20% (24.50%) of the variation in SMAs’ generation decision for free (paid) content sentiment. In addition, an SMA is more likely to produce paid content when the expected free readership increases and is less likely to do so when the expected paid subscriptions increase, evidence that SMAs do balance the preferences of different investors when monetizing content. We find that SMAs are strategic in acquiring readers via their content monetization decisions and retaining subscribers via their content generation decisions. Importantly, we uncover that the orientation of an SMA’s strategic catering behavior is driven by the audience composition effect. Our study provides new empirical evidence, associated theoretical explanations for the results, and a practical illustration of an approach to reduce the potential confirmation bias of investors who may favor information from some SMAs that are prone to strategic catering behaviors."
ISR,2025,How Recommendation Affects Customer Search: A Field Experiment,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0294,"Product recommendation and search are two technology-mediated channels through which e-commerce platforms can help customers find products. However, the relationship between the two channels and the underlying mechanisms and implications for platform design are not well understood. We leverage a randomized field experiment with 555,800 customers on a large e-commerce platform to investigate how product recommendation affects customer search. We vary the relevance of the recommendation that users experience upon arriving at the home page of the platform and find that a decrease in recommendation relevance leads to a significant increase in consumers’ use of the search channel, indicating a (partial) substitution effect between the two at the aggregate level. We find substantial heterogeneity across product categories, propose a conceptual framework, and theorize how different states of customer demand—demand fulfillment and demand formation—may drive such heterogeneity. The results are aligned with our framework and provide evidence that both demand formation and fulfillment are at work in the channel interactions between recommendation and search. Specifically, when customers receive more product recommendations in a category, they search more in that category with generic query words, which indicates complementarity between recommendation and search. However, when customers receive fewer product recommendations in a category of interest, they compensate for this reduction by searching more in that category with long-tail query words, which indicates a substitution between recommendation and search. This experimental study is among the first to examine the causal relationship between the recommendation channel and search channel and offers implications for the design of e-commerce platforms."
ISR,2025,Understanding Volunteer Crowdsourcing from a Multiplex Perspective,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0290,"Crowdsourcing is about leveraging information technologies to outsource tasks to a large group of people, who can either be paid workers or nonpaid workers. Differing from monetarily incentivized workers, nonpaid workers are more likely to be affected by coworking relationships. To explore the link between the network and volunteering behavior, we construct dynamic collaboration networks from 827,260 unique volunteers’ participation in 183,445 projects initiated by 74,556 nonprofit organizations over nine years in the capital city of China. Following a multiplex perspective, we allow each type of organization (i.e., school-based, community-based, other-based) to represent a separate network layer. We construct the measures of multiplex ties (i.e., social connections that are linked through multiple layers) and relational pluralism (i.e., involvement diversity in different layers). We find that volunteers with more multiplex ties and a lower level of relational pluralism have higher volunteering continuity and intensity of engagement, guaranteeing the supply of the volunteer labor force. However, they are less likely to explore unfamiliar organizations through interorganization movements. At a macro level, we show how the reduced interorganization movements impeded the development of small and newly established organizations. In addition, we show that incorporating these multiplexity measures improves the prediction of volunteer behavior by 5.390%, 1.624%, and 8.792% for continuity, movement, and engagement, respectively."
ISR,2025,Regulating Powerful Platforms: Evidence from Commission Fee Caps,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0191,"Platform giants typically possess strong power over other participants on the platforms. Such power asymmetry gives platform owners the edge on setting platform fees to capture the surplus created on their platforms. Although there is a heated debate on regulating these powerful platforms, the lack of empirical studies hinders the progress toward evidence-based policymaking. This research empirically investigates this regulatory issue in the context of on-demand delivery. Delivery platforms (e.g., DoorDash) charge restaurants a commission fee, which can be as high as 30% per order. To support small businesses, recent regulatory scrutiny has started to cap the commission fees for independent restaurants. This research empirically evaluates the effectiveness of platform fee regulation, by investigating recent regulations across 14 cities and states in the United States. Our analyses show that independent restaurants in regulated cities (i.e., those paying reduced commission fees) experience a decline in orders and revenue, whereas chain restaurants (i.e., those paying the original fees) see an increase in orders and revenue. This intriguing finding suggests that chain restaurants, not independent restaurants, benefit from the regulations that were intended to support independent restaurants. We find that platforms’ discriminative responses to the regulation may explain the negative effects on independent restaurants. That is, after cities enact commission fee caps, delivery platforms become less likely to recommend independent restaurants to consumers, and instead turn to promoting chain restaurants. Moreover, delivery platforms increase their delivery fees for consumers in regulated cities, suggesting that these platforms attempt to cover the loss of commission revenue by charging customers more."
ISR,2025,Understanding Lenders’ Investment Behavior in Online Peer-to-Peer Lending: A Construal Level Theory Perspective,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2020.0428,"Online peer-to-peer lending (i.e., P2P lending) has grown rapidly in recent years and is a new source of fixed income for investors. However, there is limited understanding of factors affecting individual lenders’ decision making in this context, which is characterized as highly risky. Drawing on construal level theory, we theorize how bidding amounts lenders submit are affected by interest rates and psychological distance caused by the borrower’s demographic attributes (i.e., geographic location, age, educational degree, and marital status) relative to those of the lender. Specifically, we study how psychological distance directly influences and shapes the effects of the duality of interest rates (i.e., as rates of return and as signals of potential risk) on bidding amounts. Using a rich data set from a popular Chinese online P2P lending platform, we apply multiple identification strategies and estimation methods to conduct our analyses. We find that geographic distance decreases the lenders’ bidding amounts (i.e.,home bias effect), whereas social distance increases the bidding amounts (i.e.,social distance effect). In addition, the positive effects of interest rates on bidding amounts are strengthened by the geographic and social distance between the lender and the borrower. Furthermore, we conduct four controlled experiments to explore the causality and mechanisms behind these relationships. Theoretical contributions and practical implications are discussed."
ISR,2025,Enhancing User Privacy Through Ephemeral Sharing Design: Experimental Evidence from Online Dating,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0379,"Users on online dating platforms tend to encounter a cold-start problem, with limited user engagement in the initial stages of the matching process; this is partially due to privacy concerns. In this study, we propose ephemeral sharing as a privacy-enhancing design to strike a balance between users’ privacy concerns and the need for voluntary information disclosure. Ephemeral sharing refers to a digital design in which the information shared (e.g., a personal photo) becomes invisible and irretraceable to the receiver shortly after the receipt of such information. In partnership with an online dating platform, we report a large-scale randomized field experiment with more than 70,000 users to understand how ephemeral sharing influences users’ disclosure of personal photos, match outcome, and receiver engagement. The experiment features a treatment group in which subjects can upload an ephemeral photo along with their matching request and a control group in which subjects can instead upload a persistent photo. We find that users in the treatment group send more personal photos (and ones with human faces) compared with users in the control group. Additionally, the ephemeral sharing treatment leads to a higher number of matches and a higher level of receiver engagement. Further analyses suggest that the treatment effects are more salient for privacy-sensitive senders. Moreover, we find that the treatment effects on match outcome and receiver engagement can be explained by increases in the disclosure of personal photos. Last, through an online experiment, we show that ephemeral sharing increases disclosure intention by reducing privacy concerns related to data collection, dissemination, and identity abuse. Our study contributes to the literature and practice on privacy-enhancing designs for online matching platforms."
ISR,2025,Mobile Push vs. Pull Targeting and Geo-Conquesting,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0206,"This study examines the impact of different mobile content delivery mechanisms on consumers’ coupon redemption behavior. Firms have two distinct content delivery options when engaging with consumers’ mobile devices:mobile pushandmobile pull. Mobile push delivers firm-initiated (ad) content directly to consumers, whereas mobile pull requires consumers to initiate requests for (ad) content. We hypothesize that mobile push delivery increases the likelihood of coupon redemption due to reduced app-specific search costs compared with mobile pull. We further examine how app-specific use experience and store density influence the heterogeneity of consumer responses. To test our hypotheses, we conducted a large-scale randomized field experiment in a geo-conquesting setting, targeting customers located around competitor retail stores with mobile coupons to drive them to stores of the focal retailer. Our results reveal that mobile push increases coupon redemption rates by 6.0%, with substantial heterogeneity based on app-specific use experience and store density. Notably, app-specific usage experience negatively moderates the effect of mobile push delivery on redemptions, likely because both usage experience and push notifications reduce app-specific search costs, thereby acting as substitutes for one another. In areas with higher store density, the positive effect of mobile push delivery on the redemption likelihood is greater, suggesting that push notifications can highlight the focal coupon among alternative store choices, thereby lowering consumer switching costs. These findings have important implications for retailers and brands in creating competitive mobile targeting campaigns that effectively leverage both mobile push and pull delivery mechanisms."
ISR,2025,Signaling Effects Under Dynamic Capacity in Online Matching Platforms: Evidence from Online Health Consultation Communities,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0150,"Match formation is challenging in online matching platforms where suppliers are subject to dynamic capacity constraints. We provide a theoretical foundation for understanding how online matching platforms support the transmission and triangulation of multisource information for consumers to infer provider service quality and dynamic capacity states, and achieve desirable matching outcomes. Situating this study in the context of an online health consultation community (OHCC) and drawing upon signaling theory, we theorize how physicians’ owned and earned signals influence physicians’ voluntary online consultations with new patients they have not consulted with previously. Importantly, we articulate how these signaling effects are contingent upon physicians’ dynamic capacity in OHCC. We collected longitudinal data from a large OHCC in China and used a hidden Markov model (HMM) to characterize the dynamic physician capacity in the OHCC and test the hypotheses. Our findings reveal that service professionals’ owned and earned signals interactively work together to balance supply and demand dynamically, and thereby facilitating matchmaking. In OHCCs, where physicians provide voluntary service beyond their primary jobs at hospitals, we find that owned and earned signals increase patient consultations in different patterns contingent upon physicians’ capacity states. In addition, we discover the complementary and substitute relationships between owned signals and earned signals change when physicians are in different capacity states. The findings have significant implications for our understanding of online match formation under dynamic capacity constraints and the design of OHCCs."
ISR,2025,Linking Clicks to Bricks: Understanding the Effects of Email Advertising on Multichannel Sales,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2020.0557,"Businesses have widely used email ads to directly send promotional information to consumers. Whereas email ads serve as a convenient tool to allow firms to target consumers online, there is little evidence of their multichannel impact on consumer spending in both online and brick-and-mortar stores. In this paper, we utilize a unique high-dimensional data set from one of the world’s largest office supplies retailers to link each consumer’s online behaviors to item-level purchase records in physical stores. We employ a doubly robust estimator that incorporates nonparametric machine learning methods for causal estimation on observational data. Our results show that email ads significantly increase the retailer’s sales across different channels. We also investigate the effects of email ads on diverse consumer behaviors along the purchase funnel and find that increased sales result from increased purchase probability and a wider variety of products purchased by consumers. Further, we examine several moderating factors, such as product types and consumer segments, that influence the multichannel effects of email advertising. Overall, our study provides empirical evidence for the economic impact of email ads on consumer behavior across different channels and the underlying mechanisms thereof. Our findings offer direct implications for multichannel retailers seeking to improve their digital marketing strategies, as well as for policymakers interested in evaluating the economic impact of prevalent email advertising."
ISR,2025,How Hospitals Differentiate Health Information Technology Portfolios for Clinical Care Efficiency: Insights from the HITECH Act,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0260,"Hospitals have implemented health information technology (HIT) for clinical care to address rising operating costs in recent years. We integrate behavioral and institutional perspectives to explain how hospitals differentiate technological search relative to industry peers (i.e., search differentiation) for HIT portfolios. In the context of the U.S. healthcare industry, we theorize that hospitals’ search differentiation for HIT results jointly from idiosyncratic learning in response to cost-based performance shortfalls and isomorphic pressures in relation to changing policy uncertainty as the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act has unfolded. Based on a panel data set from 3,319 hospitals in 2007–2014, we demonstrate that when costs increase relative to aspiration level, a hospital differentiates its search for HIT by exploring more novel technologies for clinical care relative to peers. As policy uncertainty declines from the conceptualization phase to the enactment phase of the HITECH Act, a hospital’s search differentiation for HIT increases to a greater extent in response to cost-based performance shortfalls as lower uncertainty reduces the need to imitate peers’ search. As policy uncertainty further declines from the enactment phase to the enforcement phase of the HITECH Act and reaches its lowest level, however, the hospital’s search differentiation for HIT increases to a smaller extent in response to cost-based performance shortfalls because of policy incentives and professional norms to promote implementation of common technologies. Overall, we provide a more holistic picture of how uncertainty in a dynamic regulatory context intertwines with organizational learning from performance feedback in shaping search differentiation."
ISR,2025,Blessing or Curse? Implications of Data Brokers for Publisher Competition,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0227,"The abundance of consumer data has given rise to a new data broker industry that plays a pivotal role in targeted advertising. Many publishers rely on data brokers to gain (i)individual insightsdrawn from their own data or (ii)collective insightsdrawn from both their data and those of their competitors, thus improving their targeting capabilities. As data brokers control large volumes of data, they can govern how data insights are sold to downstream publishers. Despite their importance, prior studies provide little insight into the strategic function of data brokers and their subsequent impact on downstream competition. To address this research gap, we build an analytical model to analyze the interactions among a data broker, two competing publishers, and advertisers. Our analysis yields several novel findings. First, we show that the data broker may strategically set prices in a manner that leads to the exclusive selling of collective insights to one publisher, as opposed to nonexclusive selling involving two publishers. This result implies that it may be advantageous for the data broker to pursue an exclusive strategy that makes data insights scarcer for some firms. Second, we illustrate that competition between publishers can be either facilitated or impeded by the data broker depending on the broker’s interests when selling the data insights. Finally, the data broker may induce both competition-mitigation and value-enhancing effects that affect aggregate welfare. Interestingly, although the data broker’s decision (i.e., exclusive selling) may reduce market competition, the aggregate welfare can still improve because collective insights allow publishers to increase their targeting value for advertisers more efficiently."
ISR,2025,Punished for Success? A Natural Experiment of Displaying Clinical Hospital Quality on Review Platforms,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0630,"The healthcare market faces severe information asymmetry; patients struggle to evaluate the quality of hospitals and make informed decisions about their healthcare. Review platforms (e.g., Yelp) have begun to display the clinical quality of hospitals (alongside consumer reviews) to inform patients about hospital selection. In 2017 and 2019, Yelp introduced a feature with clinical measures of maternity care for hospitals that deliver babies in select markets. We study how clinical quality measures displayed on Yelp—especially for those (clinically) high-quality hospitals—influence subsequent patients’ ratings of hospitals. Our difference-in-differences estimation shows that when clinical quality measures are displayed, high-quality hospitals are surprisingly punished with lower subsequent ratings on Yelp, especially hospitals with low staffing capacity. This novel finding is consequential for hospitals as patient dissatisfaction can jeopardize the federal funding that hospitals receive (CMS.gov). To tease out the underlying mechanism, we queried SafeGraph’s precise foot traffic data, and we observed a significant patient surge for hospitals that have high maternity care clinical scores displayed on Yelp. We used transfer deep learning to show that because of the patient surge, (only) hospitals with high maternity scores that were short staffed received significantly more negative patient reviews and more complaints about key hospital service areas, thus driving patient dissatisfaction and lower ratings. We contribute to theory and practice by elucidating the role of publicly displaying clinical quality measures in patient (dis-)satisfaction with hospitals."
ISR,2025,"On-Demand, Long-Term, or Hybrid? An Economic Analysis of Optimal Rental Models on Sharing Platforms",https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0441,"The rapidly growing sharing economy is characterized by improved resource utilization through peer-to-peer transactions. Sharing platforms usually adopt one of three rental models, long-term, on-demand, and hybrid, where the long-term rental requires full dedication of resources to market over a predefined period, the on-demand rental allows resources to be exchanged for a fraction of the period, and the hybrid rental model provides both options. We develop an analytical model consisting of a monopolistic sharing platform that connects renters with owners who have heterogeneous asset utilization and incur different setup and transaction costs of participation under different rental models. We identify the conditions under which each of the three rental models can emerge as the platform’s optimal rental strategy and further examine their impacts on social welfare and consumer surplus. We find that the relative setup cost and the relative transaction cost between owners and renters play a crucial role in shaping the equilibrium market price and optimality of the three rental models, whereas the total costs determine the equilibrium transaction volume and sustainability of the three rental models. Only when the total cost is low can all three models be sustainable, and each model could emerge to be optimal in the presence of a moderately high relative transaction cost on the owners’ side. Specifically, when the owners’ setup cost is significantly higher than the renters’, the on-demand model is optimal. When the owners’ setup cost is significantly lower than the renters’ and the renter’s setup cost is low, the long-term model is optimal. Only when their setup costs are comparable or when the owners’ setup cost is significantly lower than the renters’ and the renter’s setup cost is high can the hybrid model be optimal. When the platform optimally chooses the long-term or hybrid model, it also generates the highest social welfare, and in a wide range of parameter regions, it also yields the highest consumer surplus, leading to a win–win outcome. Overall, our results offer important new insights into the platform’s optimal rental-model choice in the sharing economy and its implications for consumers and society."
ISR,2025,Gaining a Seat at the Table: Enhancing the Attractiveness of Online Lending for Institutional Investors,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0638,"Although online lending enjoyed explosive growth in the past decade, its market size remains small compared with other financial assets. The risk of losing money, stringent government regulations, and low awareness of the benefits have hampered the realization of the full potential of the online lending market. Because online loans are an emerging asset class, investors may not be aware of the investment performance of online loans compared with other assets, and it remains an open question whether online loans offer sufficiently attractive returns to warrant inclusion in an asset allocation decision. To attract lenders, platforms must provide an appealing investment opportunity which entails construction of portfolios of loans that investors find attractive. We propose general characteristics-based portfolio policy (GCPP), a novel framework to overcome the difficulties associated with portfolio construction of loans. GCPP directly models the portfolio weight of a loan as a flexible function of its characteristics and does not require direct estimation of the distributional properties of loans. Using an extensive data set spanning over one million loans from 2013 to 2020 from LendingClub, we show that GCPP portfolios can achieve an average annualized internal rate of return (IRR) of 8.86%–13.08%, significantly outperforming an equal-weight portfolio of loans. We then address the question of whether online loans can earn competitive rates of return compared with traditional investment vehicles through six market indices covering stocks, bonds, and real estate. The results demonstrate that a portfolio of online loans earns competitive or higher rates of return compared with traditional asset classes. Furthermore, the IRRs of the loan portfolios have small correlations with the benchmark index IRRs, pointing toward significant diversification benefits. Together, we demonstrate that GCPP is an approach that can help platforms better serve both borrowers and lenders en route to growing their business."
ISR,2025,Growing Technological Relatedness to the ICT Industry and Its Impacts,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2020.0627,"We create an intersectoral citation network using 1.3 million patents granted between 1981 and 2010 across all industries in the United States. In this network space, we find a significant increase over time in the proximity of non–information and communication technologies (ICT) industries to the ICT industry. Such “ICT-closeness” of an industry relates to a significant increase in the proportion of ICT technologies in the industry’s patent portfolio and complementarity between ICT and non-ICT patents in its portfolio. We hypothesize and find that ICT-Closeness has a significant positive impact on innovation outcomes of the citing industry, including innovative efficiency, recombinant capabilities, and creation of new products, services, and business methods. ICT-closeness also engenders hypercompetition in the citing industries, as reflected in greater winner-take-all dynamics and turbulence. Our results point to a paradigm shift in knowledge production, and in turn, sources of competitive value across diverse industries."
ISR,2025,Guided Diverse Concept Miner (GDCM): Uncovering Relevant Constructs for Managerial Insights from Text,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2020.0494,"Guided Diverse Concept Miner (GDCM) is an interpretable deep learning algorithm to (1) automatically extract corpus-level concepts from text data, (2) focus the discovery of concepts to filter through only the concepts highly correlated to the user-specified managerial outcome, and (3) quantify the concept’s correlational importance to the outcome. GDCM is used to explore and potentially extract previously unknown concepts and insights from the text that may explain the managerial outcome, without the need to provide any human-predefined guidance or labeled data on concepts. GDCM embeds words, documents, and concepts all in the same vector space, enabling easy interpretation of discovered concepts by associating words local to the concept vector. GDCM is explicitly configured to increase recovered-concept diversity, coherence, and relevance to managerial outcomes. We demonstrate GDCM as a “guided exploratory” tool for a hypothetical managerial case involving online purchase journey data connected to consumed reviews. GDCM scalably extracts concepts hidden in customer reviews highly correlated to conversion and provides concept importance in comparison with product ratings. Concepts produced turn out to be product qualities previously theorized to impact conversion in the literature, and correlational importance gauged by GDCM closely matches estimates from a previous causal study run on a similar data set, serving as external validations of GDCM as a “guided exploratory” tool. Additional experiments with other data show that extracted insights are sensitive to guiding managerial variables and sensibly so, further demonstrating the flexibility of GDCM as a managerial tool."
ISR,2025,"1 + 1 > 2? Information, Humans, and Machines",https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0305,"With the explosive growth of data and the rapid rise of artificial intelligence and automated working processes, humans inevitably fall into increasingly close collaboration with machines as either employees or consumers. Problems in human–machine interaction arise as a consequence, not to mention the dilemmas posed by the need to manage information on ever-expanding scales. Considering the general superiority of machines in this latter respect, compared with human performance, it is essential to explore whether human–machine collaboration is valuable and, if so, why. Recent studies propose diverse explanation methods to uncover machine learning algorithms’ “black boxes,” aiming to reduce human resistance and enhance efficiency. However, the findings of this literature stream have been inconclusive. Little is known about the influential factors involved or the rationale behind their impacts on human decision processes. We aimed to tackle these issues in the present study by specifically examining the joint impact of information complexity and machine explanations. Specifically, we cooperated with a large Asian microloan company to conduct a two-stage field experiment. Drawing upon studies in dual-process theories of reasoning that propose different conditions necessary to arouse humans’ active information processing and systematic thinking, we tailored the treatments to vary the level of information complexity, the presence of collaboration, and the availability of machine explanations. We observed that, with large volumes of information and with machine explanations alone, human evaluators could not add extra value to the final collaborative outcomes. However, when extensive information was coupled with machine explanations, human involvement significantly reduced the default rate compared with machine-only decisions. We disentangled the underlying mechanisms with three-step empirical analyses. We reveal that the coexistence of large-scale information and machine explanations can invoke humans’ active rethinking, which, in turn, shrinks gender gaps and increases prediction accuracy. In particular, we demonstrate that humans can spontaneously associate newly emerging features with others that had been overlooked but had the potential to correct the machine’s mistakes. This capacity not only underscores the necessity of human–machine collaboration, but also offers insights into system designs. Our experiments and empirical findings provide nontrivial implications that are both theoretical and practical."
ISR,2025,Firm-Sponsored Online Communities: Building Alignment Capabilities for Participatory Governance,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0578,"Firm-sponsored online communities face governance challenges because of differences in the goals and values between the community and the sponsor. This study focuses on better understanding how these communities combine firm-based and community-based governance to achieve participatory governance, balancing firm goals with the autonomy and participation of volunteer members. Through a case study of Mayo Clinic Connect, an online patient community sponsored by Mayo Clinic, we uncover how firm and community stakeholders jointly align firm- and community-based governance. We introduce the concept of a governance alignment capability, which helps avoid and resolve governance tensions, contributing to the success of participatory governance. We specifically uncover two governance alignment mechanisms: informalizing the formal and formalizing the informal. These mechanisms adapt firm-based governance to align more closely with community norms and standardize community-based governance within the firm’s governance structure. The study contributes to both the nascent literature on firm-sponsored online communities and the broader literature on governance by highlighting the importance of participatory governance capabilities in balancing effectiveness and legitimacy in firm-sponsored online communities and emphasizing governance as a dynamic, rather than a static, system."
ISR,2025,Conversation Analytics: Can Machines Read Between the Lines in Real-Time Strategic Conversations?,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0415,"Strategic conversations involve one party with an informational advantage and another with an interest in the information. This paper proposes machine learning–based methods to quantify the evasiveness and incoherence of the more-informed party during real-time strategic conversations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in a real-world setting, we consider the question-and-answer sessions of earnings conference calls, during which managers face scrutinizing questions from analysts. Being reluctant to disclose adverse information, managers may resort to evasive answers and sometimes respond less coherently than they otherwise would. Using data from the earnings calls of S&P 500 companies from 2006 to 2018, we show that the proposed measures predict worse next-quarter earnings. The stock market also perceives incoherence as a negative signal. This paper contributes methodologically to business analytics by developing machine learning methods to extract behavioral cues from real-time strategic conversations. We believe the wide adoption of these tools can increase the efficiency of various markets and institutions where real-time strategic conversations routinely occur, which ultimately benefits business and society."
ISR,2025,The Impact of “Retail Media” on Online Marketplaces: Insights from a Field Experiment,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0188,"Advertising on e-commerce marketplaces, wherein sponsored product listings are interleaved with organic product listings in the search results, is a large and growing phenomenon that falls under the umbrella of “retail media.” In this paper, taking the perspective of the marketplace, we obtain insights into the impact of sponsored listings being shown at the most salient positions in the list of results. To do so, we analyze data from a large-scale field experiment at Flipkart, a leading online marketplace in India. We find nuanced results that substantially vary across categories. In the electronics category, the sponsored listings perform worse (in terms of clicks and conversions) than the organic listings that they replace, whereas the organic listings in the neighborhood of the sponsored listings perform better than in the absence of the sponsored listings. Surprisingly, these effects are reversed in the clothing and footwear categories, in which the ads perform better than the displaced organic listings, suggesting that sponsored listings might help the platform identify new high-relevance products and improve search rankings for these categories. However, at the search level, because of the countervailing impacts on sponsored listings and neighboring organic listings (even though the directions of these effects are different for different categories), we find that increasing the fraction of sponsored listings (by about 10% points) does not affect clicks and conversions in any product category. This implies that ads bring in additional revenue for the marketplace yet do not hurt overall consumer response (in the short run). We theorize that the variation across categories occurs because of differing degrees of information asymmetry on product relevance to a query between the marketplace and the independent sellers of listed products and provide supporting evidence for this mechanism."
ISR,2025,Improving Students’ Argumentation Skills Using Dynamic Machine-Learning–Based Modeling,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0615,"Argumentation is an omnipresent rudiment of daily communication and thinking. The ability to form convincing arguments is not only fundamental to persuading an audience of novel ideas but also plays a major role in strategic decision making, negotiation, and constructive, civil discourse. However, humans often struggle to develop argumentation skills, owing to a lack of individual and instant feedback in their learning process, because providing feedback on the individual argumentation skills of learners is time-consuming and not scalable if conducted manually by educators. Grounding our research in social cognitive theory, we investigate whether dynamic technology-mediated argumentation modeling improves students’ argumentation skills in the short and long term. To do so, we built a dynamic machine-learning (ML)–based modeling system. The system provides learners with dynamic writing feedback opportunities based on logical argumentation errors irrespective of instructor, time, and location. We conducted three empirical studies to test whether dynamic modeling improves persuasive writing performance more so than the benchmarks of scripted argumentation modeling (H1) and adaptive support (H2). Moreover, we assess whether, compared with adaptive support, dynamic argumentation modeling leads to better persuasive writing performance on both complex and simple tasks (H3). Finally, we investigate whether dynamic modeling on repeated argumentation tasks (over three months) leads to better learning in comparison with static modeling and no modeling (H4). Our results show that dynamic behavioral modeling significantly improves learners’ objective argumentation skills across domains, outperforming established methods like scripted modeling, adaptive support, and static modeling. The results further indicate that, compared with adaptive support, the effect of the dynamic modeling approach holds across complex (large effect) and simple tasks (medium effect) and supports learners with lower and higher expertise alike. This work provides important empirical findings related to the effects of dynamic modeling and social cognitive theory that inform the design of writing and skill support systems for education. This paper demonstrates that social cognitive theory and dynamic modeling based on ML generalize outside of math and science domains to argumentative writing."
ISR,2025,Addressing Online Users’ Suspicion of Sponsored Search Results: Effects of Informational Cues,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0364,"Sponsored search results (SSRs) that deviate from users’ search queries often raise suspicion despite receiving positive evaluations from previous users. Such a suspicion typically prompts users to avoid SSRs. To address this issue, our study focuses on the role of online informational cues, such as product reviews and ratings from user-generated content, in reducing users’ suspicion when encountering these SSRs. Drawing on the theoretical perspective of state suspicion, we contextualize the dimensions of suspicion in the SSR context, includingdecision uncertainty,perceived malintent of the search platform, andprocessing of an SSR. We propose theory-based strategies for reducing the suspicion of users by incorporating informational cues about an SSR in the product search process in e-commerce contexts. Specifically, we theorize that the internalization of an informational cue can reduce users’ decision uncertainty and/or their perceived malintent of the platform, which will increase their processing of an SSR. Our approach also considers contingent factors that trigger users’ internalization. We conducted three laboratory experiments, and the results support our theorization. Our study uncovers the internalization mechanism of informational cues in addressing the suspicion of users in online information search contexts and offers practical implications to e-commerce platforms to facilitate users’ decision-making processes."
ISR,2025,Customer Acquisition via Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0529,"Effective customer acquisition heavily hinges on sequential targeting to ensure that appropriate marketing messages reach customers. Sequential targeting could guide customers through the acquisition process and thus, optimize long-term revenue for the firm. Toward this goal, reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated great potential in facilitating sequential targeting during user acquisition. However, decisions made by RL during this process often lack explainability. We introduce the deep recurrent Q-network with attention model, which optimizes the long-term reward of sequential targeting while enhancing the explainability of the decisions. The key idea of the proposed model is to revise Q-learning by adding an attention mechanism to create a bottleneck, forcing the model to focus on features of the next ad exposure that will lead to optimal long-term rewards. We estimate our model using a comprehensive data set from a digital bank. The empirical results show that the proposed model is explainable and also outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of long-term revenue optimization. Specifically, the attention mechanism within the model functions as forward planning. The forward planning can spot those features in the next ad exposure that are more likely to lead to the optimal outcome. We further demonstrate how the model makes targeting decisions of advertising channel choices by showing that the model can (1) learn optimal ad channels to target customers from different industries, (2) adjust advertising channels in response to dynamic customer behaviors, and (3) learn the seasonality of the customer’s industry and calibrate the ad channel correspondingly."

We empirically test our framework on a large-scale demand data set from a leading on-demand delivery platform in Europe and find strong performance gains from using our framework against several industry benchmarks across all geographical regions, loss functions, and both pre- and post-COVID periods. We translate forecast gains to economic impacts for this on-demand service platform by computing financial gains and reductions in computing costs."
ISR,2025,KETCH: A Knowledge-Enhanced Transformer-Based Approach to Suicidal Ideation Detection from Social Media Content,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0619,"Suicidal ideation (SI), as a psychiatric emergency, requires immediate assistance and intervention. Most people with SI do not actively seek help from mental health professionals, which may result in irreversible consequences. Research has shown that individuals experiencing SI increasingly express their thoughts and emotions on social media platforms, making the latter a viable venue for suicidal ideation detection (SID). This paper proposes, develops, and evaluates a knowledge-enhanced transformer-based approach (KETCH) to SID from social media content. KETCH comprises several key novel design artifacts, including a social media-oriented SI lexicon, a model-level method for integrating domain knowledge (i.e., lexicon) into a state-of-the-art transformer, and aligned dynamic embedding and lexicon-based enhancement that integrate domain relevance and contextual importance of terms to effective SID. We evaluate KETCH’s performance with social media data in two different languages collected from distinct platforms, and further examine its generalizability to user-level models for suicide risk prediction and depression detection. The results demonstrate the superior effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability of KETCH via a series of empirical evaluation and a field study. Our research makes multifold research contributions and opens up practical opportunities for timely detection and proactive intervention of SI, which can have far-reaching impacts on public health, the economy, and society."
ISR,2025,Monitoring and the Cold Start Problem in Digital Platforms: Theory and Evidence from Online Labor Markets,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0146,"Many online labor platforms employ reputation systems and monitoring systems to mitigate moral hazard. Whereas reputation systems have the potential to reduce moral hazard, they suffer from the cold-start problem, in which new entrants without an established reputation face a high entry barrier as employers predominantly select workers based on their existing reputation. Monitoring systems, providing employers with direct oversight of workers’ actions, offer a different approach. By tracking and reporting workers’ effort levels, monitoring systems reduce ex post information asymmetry and, thus, lower employers’ expected moral hazard risk from workers. However, unlike reputation systems, monitoring systems do not directly address ex ante information asymmetry, failing to assist employers in identifying the right workers. This inherent limitation raises questions about their effectiveness in resolving the cold-start problem. In this paper, we first propose a stylized theoretical model that characterizes worker entry in the presence of reputation and monitoring systems. Based on a unique data set from a leading online labor platform, we then empirically investigate the effect of monitoring systems on the entry barriers by examining the change in workers’ entry behaviors after the introduction of the monitoring system along with associated project outcomes, which include employers’ hiring preferences, hiring prices, and project performance. We exploit the differential availability of the monitoring system across two project types: time-based projects, for which the monitoring system is accessible, and fixed-price projects, for which it is not. Employing a difference-in-differences estimation with a sample including 9,344 fixed-price projects and 3,118 time-based projects, we report that the introduction of the monitoring system increases the number of bids on time-based projects by 27.8%, and the incremental bids predominantly originate from inexperienced workers who lack platform reputation. We further find that, following the introduction of the monitoring system, employers’ preference for experienced workers diminishes, accompanied by an average reduction of 19.5% in labor costs, whereas we observe no significant decrease in project completion and review rating. Our results collectively suggest that monitoring systems alleviate the cold-start problem in online platforms."
ISR,2025,A Nudge to Credible Information as a Countermeasure to Misinformation: Evidence from Twitter,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0491,"Fueled by social media, health misinformation is spreading rapidly across online platforms. Myths, rumors, and false information on vaccines are flourishing, and the aftermath can be disastrous. A more concerning trend is that people are increasingly relying on social media to obtain healthcare information and tending to believe what they read on social media. Given the serious consequences of misinformation, this study aims to explore the efficacy of a potential cure for the infodemic we face. Specifically, we focus on a countermeasure that Twitter used, which is to nudge users toward credible information when users search topics for which erroneous information is rampant. This Twitter’s policy is unique, in that the intervention is not about censorship but about redirecting users away from false information and toward facts. Our analysis uses 1,468 news articles that contain misinformation about health topics such as measles, vaccines, and cancer. Our analysis reveals that Twitter’s nudging policy reduces misinformation diffusion. After the policy introduction, a news article that contains misinformation is less likely to start a diffusion process on Twitter. In addition, tweets that contain a link to misinformation articles are less likely to be retweeted, quoted, or replied to, which leads to a significant reduction in the aggregated number of tweets each misinformation article attracts. We further uncover that the observed reduction is driven by the decrease both in original tweet posts—those that first introduce misinformation news articles to the Twitter platform—and in those resharing the misinformation, although the reduction is more significant in resharing posts. Last, we find that the effect is driven primarily by a decrease in human-like accounts that share links to unverified claims but not by a decrease in activities by bot-like accounts. Our findings suggest that a misinformation policy that relies on a nudge to a credible source rather than on censorship can suppress misinformation diffusion."

One approach involvesadaptation– using Information Technology (IT) to design business operations that can withstand and recover from such disruptions. A second approach involvesmitigation– using IT to advance environmental, social, or economic objectives that reduce the root causes and likelihood of future disruptions. However, both approaches to building digital resilience are challenging to implement. Our clinical Information Systems (IS) research article examines and reflects on how Beta Bank, an Australian fintech firm, developed an Everything-as-a-Service (EaaS) technology strategy and achieved digital resilience throughout its business operations. We explain how Beta Bank strategically leveraged EaaS to adapt to the significant disruptions caused by the Australian wildfire disaster and the global COVID pandemic of 2019–2021. We then unpack how Beta Bank further leveraged EaaS to enhance its digital resilience via a mitigation approach. Our work delineates a typology of four EaaS pathways for pursuing digital resilience, discusses the scholarly implications of EaaS as a future IS research area, and provides actionable managerial guidance through an EaaS roadmap, a strategic planning tool for those aiming to implement and benefit from this technology strategy."
EJIS,2025,Responsible social media use: how user characteristics shape the actualisation of ambiguous affordances,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2444249,"Social media’s dual role as a source of both societal benefits and harms poses significant challenges to its responsible use. While existing literature primarily focuses on organisational and regulatory responsibilities, it sometimes overlooks individual user responsibility. This paper develops a theoretical framework that suggests user characteristics – specifically, conscientiousness and moral tolerance – are key moderators in the responsible (or irresponsible) actualisation of social media’s ambiguous affordances. Grounded in virtue ethics, the framework maintains that four archetypal user characters – narcissist, dogmatist, nihilist, and altruist – shape how social media affordances are actualised. Our work contributes to the Information Systems (IS) literature by adding a nuanced understanding of how responsible use shapes and is shaped by social media users and the sociotechnical context. The framework offers a basis for future research to examine the interaction between user characteristics, affordance ambiguity, and responsible social media use, underscoring the need for technocentric and sociocentric design interventions to promote responsible use."

Currently, data sharing, when it occurs, is typically facilitated through centralised platforms or bilateral integration solutions, which are increasingly failing to meet requirements for flexibility, trustworthiness, and self-determination over shared data. Data spaces have emerged as a promising solution, built on distributed and shared infrastructure and governance frameworks. However, widespread adoption requires consensus on the necessary organisational and technical capabilities. This paper proposes a data service model and design principles for data services to clarify choices and guide decision-making. We adopt a novel perspective by conceptualising data spaces as meta-organisations to guide an Action Design Research study, utilising privileged access to key large-scale European data space projects in the mobility and automotive sectors. This paper not only develops a nascent design theory for data spaces, but also offers a practical framework, breaking down complex challenges into actionable, scientifically validated components – for further growth and adoption of data spaces."

To address this issue, we collaborated with a disability research institute to carry out an action design research (ADR) project aimed at designing an immersive virtual reality (IVR) artefact to cultivate public awareness of the social barriers faced by PWD and foster inclusive attitudes and behaviours towards them. Using technology affordance as a lens, this study went through four interwoven ADR stages to co-design and refine the IVR artefact with researchers, disability groups, IVR and media experts, and end users representing the public. Reflecting on this design process, we distilled our learnings into four design principles to prescribe what and how to craft IVR artefacts for fostering disability inclusion. These principles can guide researchers and practitioners in developing similar IVR artefacts to help address similar problems. Our co-design process, which involved PWDs, enhances the existing understanding and practice of socially inclusive design-oriented research by providing empirical evidence of working with marginalised groups in developing emerging technology artefacts."
EJIS,2025,The Insider’s Dilemma: Employed Open Source Developers’ Identification Imbalance and Intentions to Leave,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2025.2463984,"In corporate-sponsored open source software development, company-employed developers become “insiders” to the OSS community, and therefore have two roles: they serve as a representative of their employing company, but may also identify as a member of the open source community. This study investigates what happens when identification with the company exceeds identification with the community (and vice versa), and also focuses on consequences when these insider roles come in conflict. Informed by social identity theory and organization-profession conflict theory, we report on two studies that predict identification imbalance to affect company turnover intention. Our first study is based on a survey of employed Linux kernel developers and uses polynomial regression to assess the effect of identification imbalance (and congruence) on company turnover intention. The second study extends our investigation beyond Linux and demonstrates that the effect of identification imbalance on turnover intention is mediated by role conflict. The findings suggest that turnover intention is lowest, when company and community identification match at high rather than low levels. We also find developers’ company career ambition influences how role conflict relates to company turnover intention. This study holds implications for theory and for managers in companies who engage with OSS communities."
EJIS,2025,Impact of rounded rating display and confidence cues on the subsequent reviews,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2025.2471074,"Online review platforms frequently use rounded rating displays, rounding average ratings to the nearest half-star for simplicity. However, such practice can misguide consumers by creating discrepancies between displayed ratings and actual quality. For example, providers with nearly identical average ratings (e.g. 4.25 and 4.26) might be displayed as 4 and 4.5 stars, respectively, while significantly different providers (e.g. 3.76 and 4.25) might both appear as 4 stars. Such rounding misguides consumers’ pre-purchase expectations and can negatively influence post-purchase satisfaction when consumers’ experiences fail to match expectations. Despite the prevalence of rounded rating displays, their impact on subsequent review behavior remains underexplored. Using a regression discontinuity design and a controlled experiment, we investigate how rounded rating displays influence review generation. Our findings reveal that ratings rounded up (compared to rounded down) prompt consumers to leave reviews with lower ratings and less positive but more negative sentiments. Furthermore, lower rating dispersion and higher information diversity intensify these effects by strengthening consumers’ confidence on pre-purchase expectations. This study underscores the significant role of design features, such as rounded rating displays, in shaping review behavior, providing valuable insights for platform designers seeking to mitigate unintended consequences and improve the way platforms present information."
EJIS,2025,Online virtual consultation between patients and physicians as interactive affordance,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2025.2473950,"While healthcare providers have widely adopted digital health platforms for patient online virtual consultations, organizations are challenged by difficulties in utilizing them for effective physician–patient interactions. This study investigates online virtual consultations between physicians and patients enabled by their joint use of mobile social media technology. Based on affordance theory, we propose a new type of group-level affordance,interactive affordance, characterized by interactions between users with different predefined roles and varying preferences. We conceptualize interactive affordance as a second-order construct and propose the structure of interactive affordance that is affected by dyadic alignment and individual user affordances, influenced by three determinants (relative advantage, process standardization, and absorptive capacity). The interactive affordance affects two outcomes (physician and patient satisfaction). These relationships were tested using survey data collected from physicians and patients. The results show that interactive affordance actualization is affected by the dyadic alignments of their determinants, and it improves physician satisfaction. This study contributes to the affordance literature by proposing a new type of affordance, interactive affordance. It contributes to the literature on digital health technology used by users with differing preferences by showing the effects of dyadic alignment on the shared use of collaboration technology."
EJIS,2025,A field experiment on ISP training designs for enhancing employee information security compliance,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2359460,"Information security policy (ISP) training plays an important role in enhancing organisational resilience against cyber threats by providing employees with the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively identify, prevent, and respond to security breaches. This research aims to explore how the use of deterrence arguments and threat arguments can enhance the effectiveness of ISP training. We theorise how ISP training affects employees’ ISP compliance behaviour by arguing for a transfer of training lens to study the effectiveness of ISP training. The results of our field experiment with triangulated data suggest that the effect of argumentative-enhanced ISP training is twofold. First, employees who participated in enhanced training sessions with deterrence and threat arguments demonstrated superior training outputs after the training, which, in turn, translated into a sustained training outcome three weeks after the training. Second, we also find evidence that threat arguments can reinforce the application of training outputs in the maintenance stage of learned behaviours. With this applied research study, we contribute to the research and practice by providing empirical evidence of the effectiveness of ISP training designs."
EJIS,2025,The co-evolution of contract and software artefact in cloudsourcing,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2380707,"Propelled by the promise of cost savings and enhanced service quality, cloudsourcing has become the largest segment of the global outsourcing market. In practice, however, managing cloudsourcing projects is notoriously challenging because they morph into complex, multi-year endeavours that entail frequent adaptations of both the cloud service and the contract in response to emergent goals. This study develops and explores the idea that in this adaptation process, the outsourcing contract and software artefact become closely connected. When making contracting decisions, clients must consider that cloud services are built on standardised multi-tenant architectures, offer predefined customisation options, and evolve continuously. Therefore, we explore the dynamic interplay between contract and cloud-based software artefact in response to emergent goals. Drawing from a longitudinal study of four cloudsourcing cases, we reveal two patterns: co-evolutionary polarisation and co-evolutionary harmonisation. The former, driven by positive reinforcement, intensifies tensions between initial and emergent goals, manifesting in projects drifting away from goals. The latter, characterised by balancing feedback, facilitates a flexible trajectory, enabling stepwise reconciliation of initial and emergent goals. These findings offer significant theoretical contributions to the management of sourcing projects, especially in cloud contexts, and provide actionable insights for managers navigating the complex dynamics of cloudsourcing."
EJIS,2025,Achieving strategic alignment between business and information technology with information technology governance: the role of commitment to principles and Top Leadership Support,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2390998,"IT governance (ITG) is crucial in achieving IT strategic alignment, but many organizations find this to be an elusive goal. We thus expand ITG into two components: ITG mechanisms and ITG principles. We propose that beyond the mere option of ITG mechanisms, organizations must fully embrace the broader “spirit” of ITG, which occurs when an organization is committed to ITG principles coupled with top leadership support. To test our theorization, we first developed and validated two new measures. We used the ITG framework of COBIT to create a measure of commitment to COBIT principles (CCP), and we found that CCP fully mediates ITG mechanisms’ relationship with strategic alignment. We thus illuminate a missing link between adopting ITG mechanisms and achieving strategic alignment by demonstrating the need to focus on ITG principles. We show that top leadership support for IT, including support at the board level, not only enhances CCP but also directly contributes to improved strategic alignment. Our study establishes that adopting ITG mechanisms is necessary but insufficient for achieving strategic alignment. Effective organizations go beyond implementing isolated ITG mechanisms; they fully embrace integrated COBIT-based principles, guided by a strong infusion of top leadership support, including board-level support."
EJIS,2025,Reducing the incidence of biased algorithmic decisions through feature importance transparency: an empirical study,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2395531,"As firms move towards data-driven decision-making using algorithmic systems, concerns are raised regarding the lack of transparency of these systems which could have ramifications related to users’ trust and the potential for provoking discriminatory decisions. Although previous research has developed methods to improve algorithmic transparency, little empirical evidence exists regarding the extent of the effectiveness of these approaches. Drawing upon Rest’s theory of ethical decision-making and the literature on algorithmic transparency and bias, we investigate the effectiveness of feature importance (FI), a common transparency-enhancing approach, which illustrates the nature and the weights of the features utilised by an algorithm. Through an online experiment employing a fictitious tool that provided recommendations for selecting employees for a promotion-related training programme, we find that FI is effective when biased recommendations include direct discrimination (i.e. when individuals are treated less favourably on protected grounds such as gender); but is of little assistance when discrimination is indirect (i.e. when a criterion or practice that is apparently neutral, disadvantages a group of individuals who are of a protected class). Additionally, we propose a new transparency approach, using aggregated demographic information, to accompany FI in indirect discrimination circumstances and report the results of testing its effects."
EJIS,2025,Examining the impact of mobile gambling harm minimisation features: a dualistic model of passion perspective,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2396964,"Driven by the ubiquity of smartphones, sports gambling has intensified globally. Most mobile gambling apps are mandated to offer harm minimisation features which are IT tools designed to help prevent harmful gambling activity. Existing research on the effectiveness of gambling harm minimisation features often overlooks the fact that individuals engage with multiple IT tools to varying extents to achieve a single goal. As an initial step, and to reflect actual user engagement, we conduct an exploratory factor analysis on a range of opt-in harm minimisation features. Next, aligned with the dualistic model of passion, we theorise and empirical test how direct and indirect harm minimisation features moderate the translation of different passions for mobile gambling into the well-being outcome of subjective vitality. Our findings suggest that indirect harm minimisation features, but not direct features, are effective in protecting the well-being of obsessively passionate mobile gamblers. For harmoniously passionate mobile gamblers, the opposite situation holds – direct harm minimisation features strengthen the effect of a harmonious passion on vitality whereas indirect features have no significant effect."
EJIS,2025,Determinants of gamification effectiveness: perspectives of technology affordances and coping responses in the context of team-based gamified training,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2398600,"Firms face significant challenges in effectively training employees in adopting complex information systems, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP). Gamified training has emerged as a promising means to address these challenges. Despite this, prior research has paid little attention to the factors affecting the effective use of gamified training. This study aims to identify the determinants of the effective use of gamified training. Based on technology affordances, coping, and gamification literature, the study proposes that team-based gamification affordances (e.g. collaboration and competition affordances) affect coping responses (e.g. task-focused, emotion-focused, and avoidance coping), leading to effective use. We utilized the ERP simulation game to empirically test the research model, employing a multi-study approach comprising two studies (Study 1 = 255 participants, Study 2 = 219 participants). Structural equation modelling was used for data analysis. Our results indicate that collaboration affordance significantly affects task-focused, emotion-focused, and avoidance coping. However, competition affordance influenced only task-focused coping. We also found that task-focused and emotion-focused coping affected effective use. This study contributes to IS literature by highlighting gamification affordances and coping responses as important predictors of effective use in gamified training, leading organizations and IS scholars to design impactful and engaging gamified training programmes."
EJIS,2025,Unveiling motivational configurations in shaping meaningful engagement in green gamification,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2404968,"Green gamification embeds game elements into non-game green information systems to tackle environmental degradation by encouraging pro-environmental behaviours. However, its real-world impact has been limited by a lack of meaningful engagement among users. To overcome this challenge, it is crucial to promote meaningful engagement through motivations and explore the intricate relationships that underlie them. We propose a configurational model based on self-determination theory to explore how different motivations combine to impact the two meaningful engagement outcomes: experiential outcome (participation for positive experience) and instrumental outcome (participation to fulfil specific tasks). Using a two-wave longitudinal design with both subjective and objective data, we conduct necessary condition analysis and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to identify four configurations that stimulate meaningful engagement. Specifically, the experiential outcome is driven by a combination of high hedonic, high pro-environmental, high social interaction, and low recognition motivations. The instrumental outcome is enhanced by configurations of high intrinsic (hedonic and achievement), low pro-environmental, and high self-expression (or low recognition) motivations. These findings yield four propositions that provide a theoretical foundation for future research and practical insights for designing more effective green gamification applications."
EJIS,2025,From cyber benign to cyber malicious: unveiling the evolution of insider cyber maliciousness from a stage theory perspective,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2413072,"Insider cyber maliciousness presents a significant challenge to organizational security. Existing research has focused on identifying determinants of malicious cyber behavior but has not accounted for the progression insiders go through in arriving at the point where they look to harm their employers. This knowledge gap prevents organizations from potentially derailing acts of cyber maliciousness through timely interventions. Based on interviews with a cross-industry sample of organizational insiders, this study adopts a stage theory development approach to explore the progression of insiders from cyber benign to cyber malicious. Stage theories are useful frameworks that help explain how individuals’ perceptions, emotions, and/or behaviors progress through distinct and qualitatively different stages of development. By uncovering the initial, subsequent, and recurring perceptions and emotions that drive insiders to engage in malicious cyber activities, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the phenomenon. Our findings establish a new basis for understanding insider cyber maliciousness, presenting it as an evolutionary progression. As such, our findings also reorient the focus of malicious insider interventions toward strain-reducing or strain-relieving interventions based on the initial, subsequent, or recurring strain experiences."
EJIS,2025,To learn or not learn from AI? Unpacking the effects of feedback valence on novel insights recall,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2426473,"Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are unique pedagogical agents, in that (1) they can generate novel insights, and (2) they tend to be treated differently by humans, because they are opaquer and more intelligent than traditional technologies. Thus, it is not clear if and how people learn novel insights through AI feedback, and if the learning process and outcomes differ compared to when the source of insights and feedback is humans. Here, we seek to address this gap with four preregistered experiments (totaln=1,766). They use a learning paradigm in which we manipulate the feedback source, feedback valence, and test instructions. The key finding is that people learn novel insights better when they receive negative feedback from AI than from humans. There is no difference in recall for positive feedback. This implies that AI as pedagogical agents are likely to outperform human feedback sources (peers or experts), or at least, be no worse. Our results further reveal that (1) people present typical human-human learning biases when receiving negative feedback from AI, namely mnemic neglect, and (2) ego bruising (as manifested in reduction in state self-esteem) and anger mediate such effects when receiving negative feedback from AI."

EJIS,2025,Impact of strategic capabilities on digital transformation success and firm performance: theory and empirical evidence,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2311137,"What is needed for organisations to succeed in digital transformation, and what is its advantage? Motivated by the ongoing high amount of failing digital transformations, this study identifies necessary predictors and outcomes of this prominent matter on the macro level. Drawing on strategic capabilities as enablers for the redefinition of business value and organisational identity in the digital era, we propose that the complementary synergies of strategic capabilities empower digital transformation success, improving firm performance. The results support the proposed model using structural equations modelling with multi-data from 154 organisations and complementary objective data. This study identifies synergistic facilitators for digital transformation success by providing an integrated portfolio of complementary capabilities (i.e., outside-in, spanning, and inside-out orientation). The study also contributes to IS research by offering a measurable conceptualisation of digital transformation success. In addition, findings empirically show the association between digital transformation success and firm performance to enable further investigations in the IS field. Finally, from the study’s findings, practical implications can guide organisations towards digital transformation success and firm performance."
EJIS,2025,Weathering the storm: examining how organisations navigate the sea of cybersecurity regulations,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2345867,"Governments around the world routinely regulate the activities of private enterprises to guide the behaviour of individuals and organisations towards acceptable norms. This holds true in a cybersecurity context. However, practitioners report that cybersecurity regulations are often out of date and compliance is confusing, expensive, and time consuming. As a result, organisational leaders are often uncertain about the practicalities of adopting and implementing the various rules, which can lead to trickle-down effects on the robustness of lower-level cybersecurity controls and compliance activities. In this research, we aim to clarify how cybersecurity regulations are operationalised in organisations, as well as reveal the compliance and performance consequences of cybersecurity regulations. To do so, we interviewed 22 senior leaders with expertise in cybersecurity regulations. Our analysis reveals 7 distinct themes (i.e., concept groupings) that are ordered within four phases (i.e., temporal stages), which we use to create the Institutional Cybersecurity Regulations Model (ICRM). The results provide a holistic view of the cybersecurity regulations process in organisations that can serve to clarify current theory relationships and inform future research. As well, the ICRM can provide a practical roadmap for managers to navigate regulatory cybersecurity challenges in their own companies."

Past work examining determinants of phishing susceptibility has been dominated by cognitive theoretical perspectives. However, recent research has also revealed the importance of emotion in phishing susceptibility. This study expands our understanding of phishing susceptibility by adopting an affective lens. Using an integrative perspective of emotion, we build on the Affective Infusion Model (AIM) to predict the effects of valence, certainty, and arousal on phishing susceptibility. We pilot our manipulations (N= 241) and then test our hypotheses using a mock phishing experiment (N= 474) in which phishing messages are sent directly to participant inboxes. We demonstrate that messages inducing positive valence and low certainty result in higher phishing susceptibility. This study contributes to phishing literature by illuminating the critical role that emotion plays in altering recipients’ susceptibility in the processing of phishing messages and has implications for scholars, practitioners, and organisations."

This study explores the nature and causation of post-adoption usage behaviours (effective utilisation after initial adoption or diffusion) within the context of AI-based voice assistants. Using a sequential mixed-methods research design, we first identify the post-adoption usage behaviours of AI-based voice assistants as a multidimensional concept comprised of routine use and extended use, then develop a contextualised model by revealing technology-specific antecedents, cognitive beliefs, and boundary conditions. By integrating results from the quantitative study and qualitative study, we find that three technology affordances (i.e., anthropomorphism affordance, interactivity affordance, and personalisation affordance) are salient antecedents of two cognitive beliefs, which further affect users’ routine use and extended use of AI-based voice assistants. Additionally, we uncover use frequency as a boundary condition and obtain a complementary view of post-adoption usage of AI-based voice assistants. The empirical research findings can extend the post-adoption IS usage literature and provide practical implications for crafting user-centred functionalities to facilitate effective human-AI interactions."

Unveiling the role of organisational resilience and environmental dynamism,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2375262,"In a dynamic environment, organisations are increasingly compelled to utilise big data analytics (BDA) to develop organisational resilience, which will help them weather disruptions and gain competitiveness. By investigating 213 Chinese firms across a diverse array of industries, this study seeks to uncover the mechanisms and boundary conditions through which BDA capability affects firm performance. Drawing on the organisational capabilities-based theory and information technology-enabled organisational capabilities perspective, we both theoretically and empirically verify that two types of organisational resilience (i.e., proactive resilience and reactive resilience) mediate the relationship between BDA capability and firm performance. Our findings reveal that environmental dynamism positively moderates the impact of BDA capability on reactive resilience and strengthens the positive mediation effect of reactive resilience on the relationship between BDA capability and firm performance. This study contributes to the information systems literature by theoretically and empirically clarifying the pivotal roles of proactive resilience and reactive resilience as mediating mechanisms and by describing the contingent effect of environmental dynamism on the relationship between BDA capability and performance. The results provide new insights into how managers deploy BDA to achieve superior performance in a dynamic environment."

Important IT decisions are frequently made in the headquarters and then propagated through the rest of the organisation. This pattern can indicate a well-organised centralised IT governance focusing on security and efficiency. The same pattern, however, cannot only impede innovation and flexibility but also has the potential to continue colonial decision structures, especially as headquarters are often in the global north. Through 27 interviews with NGO representatives – a sector that should be highly motivated to counter postcolonial tendencies – we examine IT governance structures. We observe indications of a mismatch between organisational goals and IT governance structures that can only be explained when considering postcolonialism. We need to combine explanation approaches from IT governance and postcolonial theory to explain the observed phenomenon fully. Moreover, we critically comment on IT-related decision-making structures and call for more effort in research and practice to decolonise IT and IT governance."

We clarify that covariance-based structural equation modellingcanhandle composite models, e.g. using the so-called Henseler – Ogasawara specification, agree that PLS in its original form cannot consistently estimate the parameters of reflective measurement models, and reiterate that consistent PLS is a viable means to overcome this limitation. Finally, we study the performance of PLSF-SEM through scenario analyses. Based on our results, we conclude that PLSF-SEM is inferior to covariance-based structural equation modelling and consistent PLS in almost all respects. Therefore, we cannot currently recommend the use of PLSF-SEM, and it is up to future research to demonstrate potential advantages over existing structural equation modelling techniques."

They are deeply intertwined with how humans sit. While the information systems (IS) literature has been relatively silent on this matter, emerging literature in related disciplines has begun to attend to this problem by developing various artefacts. However, researchers have oftentimes done so by basing their artefacts on engineering rationales and attending only limitedly to the interactions between artefacts and humans. These interactions are crucial because data on posture is best collected by placing sensors on humans’ backs. This calls for considering and evaluating how bodies move in relation to sensors, the emotive reactions of humans to sensors and how humans make sense of recommendations emanating from underlying artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. We uncover what these considerations of human-centredness mean for designing smart service systems for posture management and suggest that a core consideration relates totrading-offpossibilities of smart technologies and necessities emerging from practices. This study contributes to the body of knowledge on designing smart service systems and responds to calls for more IS research dealing with the prevention of chronic health conditions."

AI-powered analytics, promising effective and low-cost decision augmentation, has become a ubiquitous aspect of contemporary organisations. Unlike traditional decision support systems (DSS) designed to support decisionmakers with fixed decision rules and models that often generate stable outcomes and rely on human agentic primacy, AI systems learn, adapt, and act autonomously, demanding recognition of IS agency within AI-augmented decision making (AIADM) systems. Given this fundamental shift in DSS; its influence on autonomy, responsibility, and accountability in decision making within organisations; the increasing regulatory and ethical concerns about AI use; and the corresponding risks of stochastic outputs, the extrapolation of prescriptive design knowledge from conventional DSS to AIADM is problematic. Hence, novel design principles incorporating contextual idiosyncrasies and practice-based domain knowledge are needed to overcome unprecedented challenges when adopting AIADM. To this end, we conduct an action design research (ADR) study within an e-commerce company specialising in producing and selling clothing. We develop an AIADM system to support marketing, consumer engagement, and product design decisions. Our work contributes to theory and practice with a set of actionable design principles to guide AIADM system design and deployment."

We refer to this phenomenon as self-referential information (SRI) consumption and examine its consequences and the mechanism behind them. Building on self-awareness research and the strength model of self-control, we argue that SRI consumption heightens the state of self-awareness and thereby depletes participants’ mental resources, eventually undermining virtual meeting (VM) outcomes. Our findings from a European employee sample revealed contrary effects of SRI consumption across speaker vs listener roles. Engagement with self-view is positively associated with self-awareness, which, in turn, is negatively related to satisfaction with VM process, perceived productivity, and enjoyment. Looking at the self while listening to others exhibits adverse direct and indirect (via self-awareness) effects on VM outcomes. However, looking at the self when speaking exhibits positive direct effects on satisfaction with VM process and enjoyment."

As modern IT systems support a growing variety of uses and applications, this phenomenon intensifies, with important implications for attitude formation and use behaviors. Based on individual sensemaking theory, we define perceived IT equivocality as a user’s difficulty in making sense of an IT and theorize that this psychological phenomenon manifests through perceptions of incompleteness, fragmentation, and uncertainty. Three empirical studies (n= 419,n= 411,n= 345) were conducted to validate this multidimensional construct and examine its relevance in postadoptive use settings. The results indicate that perceived IT equivocality is negatively associated with routine and innovative use and positively associated with behavioral anxiety, confirming its theorized influence on usage patterns. In closing, we discuss the importance of the IT equivocality construct to both theory and practice, along with the limitations of our work. Our distinctive contributions include 1) conceptualizing an IS-specific psychological phenomenon, 2) developing and validating a multidimensional scale, and 3) demonstrating the behavioral potency of the construct."

Investigating patient learning in health information is essential to enabling patient empowerment using these platforms. In this study, we theoretically anchor patients’ learning processes in a health infomediary to Nonaka-Takeuchi’s Socialization, Externalization, Combination, and Internalization (SECI) learning dynamics model, with the infomediary as thebaor collaborative space for learning. We posit that questions reflect externalization for a focal learning patient, while reviews and comments reflect socialization, driving patients’ knowledge internalization. Learning with more information aids patients in health-relevant choices and actions such as a doctor consultation in a health infomediary. Three hypotheses about continued learning choices are presented and tested using data from 8,900 reconstructive surgery health infomediary users, using a multichoice mixed logit model with panel estimations. Findings show patients continue to review and comment more than questions to learn about trendy surgeries, which is counterintuitive to existing insights, whereas questions lead to learning sentiment-laden information. Exploratory analyses suggest that learning through reviews regarding post-procedural services may deter, but other learning modes motivate patients to consult a doctor. We discuss the theoretical contributions and implications for infomediary design and research."

Drawing onFeedback Theoryas a fundamental theoretical lens, we formulate a research model wherein explanations enhance informativeness and task performance, contingent on users’ prior knowledge, ultimately leading to a higher learning outcome. This research model is tested in a randomized between-subjects online experiment with 573 participants whose task is to match Google Street View pictures to their city of origin. We find a positive effect of explanations on learning outcome, which is fully mediated by informativeness, for users with less prior knowledge. Furthermore, we find that explanations positively impact users’ task performance, where this effect is direct for more knowledgeable users and fully mediated by informativeness for less knowledgeable users. We seek to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these effects of explanations on learning from AI feedback in focus groups with AI experts and users. By studying the consequences of explanations as part of AI feedback for users in non-routine inference tasks, we advance the understanding of explanations as facilitators of human learning from AI systems."
EJIS,2025,Measuring the success of social information systems: an assessment of past contributions and a guide for future research,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2025.2452900,"With the explosion of social media systems and collaborative social networks has come the challenge to evaluate whether new measures of information systems success are needed. Social Information Systems are charactersied by distinctly new features and by the changing role of system users. Many of the traditional measures of information systems success may not fully capture the range of experiences and impacts inherent with this unique class of information systems. This study presents a structured literature review to identify Social Information Systems measures found in previous studies. The DeLone and McLean Information System Success Model is then used to organise and analyse existing measures of Social Information Systems across the six dimensions of the IS Success Model: System Quality, Information Quality, Service Quality, Use, User Satisfaction, and Net Social Impacts. Research gaps are identified in terms of insufficient, missing, and needed measures. New measures are then proposed based on the theoretical concepts related to Sociability, Trust, Enjoyment, and ”Regimes of Value”. Finally, this study recommends an agenda for future research for measuring Social Information Systems success."
EJIS,2025,Sociotechnical micro-foundations for digital transformation,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2347950,"This paper introduces sociotechnical micro-foundations for digital transformation. The concept highlights how the macro-level capabilities that enable organisations to conduct digital transformation originate from competent individuals, digital resources, and their interactions. In developing the sociotechnical micro-foundation concept, we explored the sociotechnical interactions that facilitated the digital transformation of a Nordic hotel chain and how macro- and micro-level interactions are linked throughout the transformation process. Adopting a sociotechnical perspective helped us shed light on how the synergistic effect of individuals and digital resources interacting in digital transformation enables higher-level outcomes. By developing and theorising sociotechnical micro-foundations, we offer three contributions. First, we propose a concept at the micro level, the basic building block of digital transformation, that ensures the joint consideration of social and technical elements, as well as how to combine them. By showing the interaction between the macro and micro levels, we extend the current knowledge of how organisations develop macro-level capabilities for digital transformation. Second, we contribute to the micro-foundation literature, a body of knowledge that lacks a technical dimension, by demonstrating how interactions between individuals and digital resources are key to understanding what happens at the micro level. Third, we offer practical implications for managers."
EJIS,2025,Navigating role identity tensions — IT project managers’ identity work in agile information systems development,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2371813,"While the management of traditional, plan-based information systems development (ISD) projects lies with the information technology project manager (ITPM), this role is challenged in agile ISD team settings, characterised by self-managed and autonomous teams. Driven by the potential for individual, project, and organisational benefits through a deeper comprehension of these challenges, our study draws upon role identity theories to uncover identity tensions that this role creates and ways in which ITPMs engage in identity work to resolve these tensions. We conducted an in-depth, qualitative study involving interviews with ITPMs operating within agile ISD teams embedded in traditionally-managed organisations. A central contribution of our paper lies in the development of a theoretical model that unpacks how ITPMs navigate identity work tensions by engaging in specific identity work activities. By revealing the interplay between ITPMs’ role identity tensions, identity work activities, and contextual factors, our study moves beyond purely descriptive accounts and offers a nuanced understanding of the emotional and behavioural dimensions of ITPMs in their liminal position. Additionally, our work underscores the pivotal role of ITPMs as boundary spanners, bridging the gap between traditional and agile governance structures to drive digital transformation. For practitioners, we provide agile ISD team design recommendations."
EJIS,2025,How can firms unlock successful implementation of digitalisation? Firm-level evidence from manufacturing companies,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2023.2270446,"Although starting the process of digitalisation is not difficult for many global companies, successful implementation of digitalisation is much more elusive. Our study thus addresses the following research question: How can companies manage and sustain the positive outcomes of digitalisation, particularly in a volatile environment? We developed a new framework based on dynamics capabilities theory. Through an investigation of 203 Chinese manufacturing companies that have achieved varying degrees of digitalisation, we found that two primary types of strategic flexibility – resource and coordination flexibility – fully mediated the positive relationship between digitalisation and firm performance. Moreover, market turbulence enhanced the positive mediation effects of strategic flexibility (i.e., resource and coordination flexibility) on the digitalisation – performance relationship. This result suggests that when a company faces a highly uncertain market environment but seeks to maintain the performance boost resulting from digitalisation, it needs to place increased emphasis on the flexibility with which it manages and updates its resource portfolios. Our proposed moderated-mediation mechanisms contribute to strategic IS research on digitalisation by elucidating how companies can manage and sustain successful digitalisation outcomes. Our findings also provide insights managers can use to unlock successful implementation of digitalisation."
EJIS,2025,Investigating the impact of representation features on decision model comprehension,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2023.2270456,"Decision models play an important role in various areas of information systems research, including system analysis and design, compliance management, and various application domains. Decision models must be effectively presented so that analysts can assure their correctness and completeness. So far, empirical research on the cognitive effectiveness of decision models has provided partially inconclusive results. Our paper provides novel insights into the drivers of decision model comprehension by moving from a classification based on representation archetypes to granular representation features. Using an experimental research design, we discover that the decision model type must be assessed in conjunction with other representational factors, such as representation structure (expanded vs. frugal) and representation design (monochromatic vs. colours). In this way, we extend prior arguments of cognitive fit theory by demonstrating that colour can be used to compensate for a misfit of decision model and task, and structural features can further increase model comprehension. We further studied the root causes of the observed effects by using eye-tracking. Our findings have implications for both cognitive information systems research and practice, as they can be used to guide decision model users and tool vendors."
EJIS,2025,Impact of social media technologies on new product development performance: theory and empirical evidence,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2023.2270462,"In current unpredictable environments, it is essential to understand customers’ needs as quickly as possible. Social media platforms are important sources of knowledge and developing a social media capability is critical in quickly sensing customers’ requirements. Social media capability can enable firms to co-create internal knowledge between employees, functional departments, and business units and external knowledge with customers. Despite the potential of social media for innovation, prior research has not studied the internal processes that should be developed to manage and leverage the information obtained through social media. Drawing upon the IT-enabled organisational capabilities perspective and the social media affordances theory, this study proposes a research model on the impact of social media capability, social knowledge co-creation, and NPD dynamic capabilities on NPD performance. The research model was tested on a sample of large European firms using survey and secondary data. Results show that social media capability enhances NPD performance by enabling firms to co-create knowledge and developing NPD dynamic capabilities. This study contributes by: (1) operationalising and measuringsocial media capabilityandsocial knowledge co-creation; and (2) demonstrating how social media capability improves NPD performance by co-creating knowledge and developing NPD dynamic capabilities to develop new products."
EJIS,2025,The impact of cognitive biases on the believability of fake news,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2023.2272608,"Modern technologies, especially social networks, contribute to the rapid evolution and spread of fake news. Although the creation of fake news is a serious issue, it is the believability of fake news and subsequent actions that produce negative outcomes that can be harmful to individuals and society. Prior research has focused primarily on the role of confirmation bias in explaining the believability of fake news, but other biases are likely. In this research, we use theories of truth and a taxonomy of 10 cognitive biases to conduct an exploratory, qualitative survey of social media users. Five cognitive biases (herd, framing, overconfidence, confirmation, and anchoring) emerge as the most influential. We then propose aCognitive Bias Mitigation Modelof methods that could reduce the believability of fake news. The mitigation methods are grouped according to three themes as they relate to the five biases."
EJIS,2025,The rise of metric-based digital status: an empirical investigation into the role of status perceptions in envy on social networking sites,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2023.2290707,"Widespread on social networking sites (SNSs), envy has been linked to an array of detrimental outcomes for users’ well-being. While envy has been considered a status-related emotion and is likely to be experienced in response to perceiving another’s higher status, there is a lack of research exploring how status perceptions influence the emergence of envy on SNSs. This is important because SNSs typically quantify social interactions and reach with metrics that indicate users’ relative rank and status in the network. To understand how status perceptions impact SNS users, we introduce a new form of metric-based digital status rooted in SNS metrics that are available and visible on a platform. Drawing on social comparison theory and status literature, we conducted an online experiment to investigate how different forms of status contribute to the proliferation of envy on SNSs. Our findings shed light on how metric-based digital status influences feelings of envy on SNSs. Specifically, we could show that metric-based digital status impacts envy through increasing perceptions of others’ socioeconomic and sociometric statuses. Our study contributes to the growing discourse on the negative outcomes associated with SNS use and its consequences for users and society."
EJIS,2025,Citizens’ participation in local energy communities: the role of technology as a stimulus,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2302426,"Because of their focus on the acquisition of new technologies, local energy communities are increasingly being recognised as major players in the current energy transition and revealing the valuable role of technological solutions in sustainable development. Nevertheless, the success of these communities is not limited to the acquisition of technologies. Instead, it is strongly dependent on citizen participation. Prior literature has focused much more on the institutional and policy factors than on the roles of citizens and their participation in such communities, and indirectly on sustainability. To address the lack, this study aims to explain the determinants of citizen participation in local energy communities by developing a research model grounded on the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) framework, and then through a mixed-methods design, study the impact of technological factors as a stimulus on more social outcomes, namely the organism and response behaviours. Our results highlight the strong impact of sustainable technologies and gamification in citizens’ attitudes. Moreover, the research model reveals a strong influence of empowerment and pro-environmental behaviour in the citizen intention to participate in local energy communities."
EJIS,2025,Exploring the complementary effects of business analytics capabilities and π-shaped skills on innovation outcomes,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2304030,"While it is clear that business analytics (BA), on average, adds value to firms, it is less clear why some firms perform better than others in leveraging their data assets. To a large degree, prior research has attributed such differences to the human factor. Nevertheless, there is still limited knowledge concerning what impact competencies of key personnel have on generating value from BA initiatives, and to what extent such outcomes complement a firm’s investment in BA. To examine these questions, this study explores the complementary relationship between BA capabilities and π-shaped skills. It posits that the concurrent presence of both indirectly influences innovation outcomes by fostering a data-driven culture. We build on a sample of 185 individuals with supervisory positions in Turkey to unpack this process. The findings revealed that BA capabilities and π-shaped skills influence a firm’s data-driven culture, which in turn impacts the firms’ marketing innovation, and subsequently its innovative performance. That is, data-driven culture and firms’ marketing innovation are relevant underlying serial mechanisms by which BA capabilities and π-shaped skills influence innovative performance."
EJIS,2025,Adversarial knowledge-sharing in a coopetitive environment: a darknet hacker context,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2305802,"As adversarial hacker exploits proliferate the media, researchers call for more studies examining their culture, behaviours, and defence mechanisms. This study aims to understand the nature of hackers through their knowledge-sharing behaviours in a coopetitive environment. This understanding may expose emerging threats and cybercriminal activities, which are beneficial to building information security defences. Also, extracting knowledge from darknet sources can help organisations anticipate, defend, and respond to cyber-attacks. Hence, we incorporate hacker forum data and perform a detailed analysis informed by foundational social capital theory. We explore hacker knowledge-sharing patterns with respect to the malicious knowledge shared. Further, we use nonlinear approaches to understand the dynamic relationships in an environment that is both cooperative and competitive. The findings seek to clarify how forms of social capital and coopetitive factors function differently to facilitate or impede knowledge sharing in a darknet context. Specifically, the findings indicate that the sharing of malicious knowledge is non-linear, and that knowledge control (i.e., reduced knowledge sharing) occurs with malicious knowledge as it relates to status and structural positioning."
MISQ,2025,Correcting Measurement Error in Regression Models with Variables Constructed from Aggregated Output of Data Mining Models,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/6,"The burgeoning interest in data mining has catalyzed a proliferation of innovative techniques in extracting useful information from unstructured data sources, such as text and images in social sciences. One typical research design involves a two-stage process. In the first stage, researchers apply the classification algorithm to predict an individual-level categorical variable. In the second stage, researchers aggregate the predicted values to construct a group-level variable for further regression analysis. For example, text classification has been applied to classify whether a review is positive or negative. The predicted review sentiment is aggregated at the product level as a focal independent variable in a regression model to examine the impact of the average review sentiment on product sales. Since the first-stage classification will inevitably have errors, the aggregated variable may suffer from a measurement error in the regression analysis. Our study attempts to systematically investigate the theoretical properties of the estimation bias and introduce solutions rooted in theory to mitigate the issue of measurement error. We propose one exact solution and two approximated solutions based on the central limit theorem (CLT) and the law of large numbers (LLN), respectively. Our theoretical analysis and experimentation confirm that the consistency of regression estimators can be recovered across all examined scenarios and the approximated solutions offer a significantly reduced computational complexity compared to the exact solution. We also provide heuristic guidelines to choose one of three solutions."
MISQ,2025,Deliberative or Automatic: Disentangling the Dual Processes Behind the Persuasive Power of Online Word-of-Mouth,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/17,"As online reviews become increasingly indispensable for consumers, they have attracted significant attention from both practitioners and researchers. It is a common belief that the persuasive effect of online reviews involves a deliberative and conscious process. Drawing on dual-process theories and the persuasion literature, we challenge this conventional wisdom, distinguish Type 2 processing (which requires deliberation) and Type 1 processing (which occurs automatically), and disentangle their relative impacts. With a focus on review elaborateness and review exposure, we propose that the automatic process of review exposure may play a greater role than elaborateness in changing consumers’ attitudes and purchase intentions. In addition, in line with the negativity bias, we posit that the persuasive impact of review exposure (vs. elaborateness) is moderated by the valence of highly exposed reviews. The results of the two experiments provide consistent support for these predictions. Our findings complement and extend the emerging literature starting to explore the role of automatic Type 1 processing in consumers’ use of online reviews, reveal the primary driver of persuasion and its boundary condition in online word-of-mouth, and provide important implications for review platforms, product manufacturers, and retailers."
MISQ,2025,The Critical Challenge of using Large-Scale Digital Experiment Platforms for Scientific Discovery,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/5,"Robust digital experimentation platforms have become increasingly pervasive at major technology and e-commerce firms worldwide. They allow product managers to use data-driven decision-making through online controlled experiments that estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) relative to a status quo control setting and make associated inferences. As demand for experiments continues to grow, orthogonal test planes (OTPs) have become the industry standard for managing the assignment of users to multiple concurrent experimental treatments in companies using large-scale digital experimentation platforms. In recent years, firms have begun to recognize that test planes might be confounding experimental results, but nevertheless, the practical benefits outweigh the costs. However, the uptick in practitioner-led digital experiments has coincided with an increase in academic-industry research partnerships, where large-scale digital experiments are being used to scientifically answer research questions, validate design choices, and/or derive computational social science-based empirical insights. In such contexts, confounding and biased estimation may have much more pronounced implications for the validity of scientific findings, contributions to theory, building a cumulative literature, and ultimately practice. The purpose of this Issues and Opinions article is to shed light on OTPs—in our experience, most researchers are unaware of how such test planes can lead to incorrect inferences. We used a case study conducted at a major e-commerce company to illustrate the extent to which interactions in concurrent experiments can bias ATEs, often making them appear more positive than they actually are. We discuss implications for research, including the distinction between practical industry experiments and academic research, methodological best practices for mitigating such concerns, and transparency and reproducibility considerations stemming from the complexity and opacity of large-scale experimentation platforms. More broadly, we worry that confounding in scientific research due to reliance on large-scale digital experiments meant to serve a different purpose is a microcosm of a larger epistemological confounding regarding what constitutes a contribution to scientific knowledge."
MISQ,2025,“Complexity Is the Worst Enemy of Security”: Studying Cybersecurity Through the Lens Of Organizational Complexity,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/12,"Writing about computer systems twenty-five years ago, Schneier wrote that “the worst enemy of security is complexity” (Schneier, 1999), because complex systems are both easier to attack and harder to secure than simpler ones. In this essay, we provide an overview of Schneier’s complexity principle and provide our observations of how two articles in this issue, Liang et al. (2025) and Tanriverdi et al. (2025), employed this principle in their research. We also offer our ideas for why complexity and cybersecurity are especially amenable for study in the field of information systems and where future research can go from here."
MISQ,2025,Human Capital Acquisition in Response to Data Breaches,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/19,"Given the rise in the frequency and cost of data security threats, it is critical to understand whether and how companies strategically adapt their operational workforce in response to data breaches. We study hiring in the aftermath of data breaches by combining information on data breach events with detailed firm-level job posting data. Using a staggered difference-in-differences approach, we show that breached firms significantly increase their demand for cybersecurity workers. Furthermore, firms’ responses to data breaches extend to promptly recruiting public relations personnel—an act aimed at managing trust and alleviating negative publicity—often ahead of cybersecurity hires. Following a breach, the likelihood of firms posting a cybersecurity job rises by approximately two percentage points, which translates to an average willingness to spend an additional $61,961 in annual wages on cybersecurity, public relations, and legal workers. While these hiring adjustments are small for affected firms, they represent a large potential impact of over $300 million on the overall economy. Our findings underscore the vital role of human capital investments in shaping firms’ cyber defenses and provide a valuable roadmap for managers and firms navigating cyberthreats in an increasingly digital age."

MISQ,2025,"Disentangling the Customer-Level, Cross-Channel Effects of Large-Order-Advantaged Online Shipping Policies",https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/15,"A key challenge in e-commerce retail is identifying a shipping fee policy that will incentivize more online orders and sales. To achieve this, retailers occasionally alter their shipping policies. While information systems research has extensively examined e-commerce channel strategies and their interplay with offline channels, it has yet to explore the online and offline implications of changes in e-commerce shipping policies. Against this backdrop, we studied a shipping policy change designed to incentivize higher-dollar orders, specifically, a large multichannel retailer’s shift from a tiered online shipping policy to a flat-rate policy. Using rich customer-level panel data and a regression discontinuity in time approach, we demonstrate that a flat-fee online shipping policy, counterintuitively, shifts sales away from the online channel and toward the offline channel—generating 23% more offline sales across 21,028 customers in five states. Evidence from additional analyses corroborated an account based on two mechanisms: an online order aggregation effect, wherein flat-fee shipping encouraged shipping fee-sensitive shoppers to aggregate purchases into larger orders, and an offline store interpurchase effect, wherein order aggregation generated longer interpurchase periods, during which customers met their needs for smaller purchases by visiting offline stores. Thus, a flat-rate shipping policy can serve as an unexpected lever for driving multichannel behavior. These findings contribute to the e-commerce channel interplay literature within information systems research and have important implications for legacy retailers seeking to leverage their brick-and-mortar investments to fend off competition from online-native retailers such as Amazon.com."
MISQ,2025,When Algorithms Delegate to Humans: Exploring Human-Algorithm Interaction at Uber,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/16,"Algorithms are increasingly seen as capable of autonomously initiating and managing interactions with humans—for example, through delegating the rights and responsibilities for successful outcomes of shared tasks without human intervention. While research into such interactions primarily focuses on dyadic configurations, complex settings where multiple agents work together have become a nexus of more nuanced interactions that go beyond the dyad. This paper explores such interactions through the lens of delegation by investigating how many algorithms delegate to many humans in a multi-agent setting. Analyzing patent data and interviews with drivers and passengers, we unpack delegation in the context of the ride-hailing application Uber. We theorize distributed delegation as a construct capturing collective hybrid appraisal, collective hybrid distribution, and collective hybrid coordination, in which a collective of algorithms delegates by drawing on inputs from multiple human agents. Our findings highlight that distributed delegation is collective, hybrid, and relational by nature, and demonstrate the extent to which human inputs are necessary for collectives of algorithms to exercise the capacity to delegate. Distributed delegation as a continuum of algorithmic and human involvement poses a challenge for recent theories suggesting the unprecedented autonomy of algorithms from humans."
MISQ,2025,"Ruckus in the Rentals, Seeking New Arrangements: Remedying the Impact of Home-Sharing on Urban Noise",https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/20,"Drawing underutilized residential assets into the tourism economy, home-sharing platforms create tremendous economic value for their owners and users. They also, however, generate negative externalities. This study examines the impact of home-sharing property use on an externality that has been increasingly understood to have adverse consequences for human health and well-being—noise. Based on empirical analyses using a large sample of transactions from a popular platform, we show that property use increases noise, which adversely affects neighbors. More interestingly, we show that the increase in noise is mitigated when property use is spatially or temporally concentrated. Our analyses reveal that a high concentration of property use can enhance the effectiveness of deterrence created through enforcement action against noise complaints. We further conduct empirically informed simulation experiments and propose a nudging algorithm that helps platforms mitigate noise externalities while also fulfilling user preferences and maintaining revenue growth. Contributing to the burgeoning literature on platform externalities, our work highlights the need for further research on potential complementarities between platform and regulatory governance and provides platforms with an alternative approach to the reputationally expensive guest penalties for addressing noise externalities."
MISQ,2025,Ruptures During IT-enabled Change: A Sensemaking and Imbrication Analysis,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/7,"Focusing on imbrication change as conducted by designers during design and development, we undertook a 2.5-year long case study to examine how 10 hospitals configured technology and planned routine changes as they sought to transform their organizations. Our observations revealed a phenomenon we call ruptures, defined as situations that occur due to breakdowns in the process of IT-enabled change. Ruptures allow us to unpack the temporal process of identifying and resolving instances of disruptive problems during IT-enabled change. Our analysis of ruptures in this context expands the theory of imbrication to account for the role of designers. We demonstrate that three imbrication types—historical, envisioned, and realized—exist cognitively during design and influence the design process. Our results demonstrate how problems arise, how dynamic change unfolds through sensemaking, and how fractal, embedded, imbrications complicate the IT-enabled change process."
MISQ,2025,Taming Complexity in the Cybersecurity of Multihospital Systems: The Role of Enterprise-Wide Data Analytics Platforms,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/14,"A widely accepted notion in cybersecurity practice and research posits that complexity is detrimental to cybersecurity. While this notion mainly focuses on IT, the prevalence of complexity extends beyond IT into organizational domains. Whether the assertion that complexity is detrimental to cybersecurity holds true when applied to organizational domains remains largely unexplored. Moreover, “complexity” and “complicatedness” are often used interchangeably to refer to a large number of interconnected components. We build on complexity science to distinguish the two terms: complexity arises from ad hoc, nonlinear interactions among interconnected components, whereas complicatedness arises from structured, linear interactions. The field lacks sufficient understanding of these distinctions and their implications for cybersecurity risks and mitigations. We theorize how an organization’s complicatedness and complexity in both IT and organizational domains influence cybersecurity breaches. Our context of empirical inquiry is multihospital systems (MHSs), a complex organizational form that uses IT in complex ways. Drawing on complexity science, we posit that complicatedness in medical services, health IT, and the governance arrangements of an MHS increases cybersecurity breaches. We also posit that using enterprise-wide data analytics platforms (EWDAPs) to structure and control ad hoc information sharing practices of the complicated units can reduce breaches despite adding more technology components and dependencies to enterprise IT. We tested these ideas in a sample of 445 MHSs in the U.S. spanning from 2009 to 2017. Complicatedness in medical services, health IT, and governance stands out as the primary contributor to cybersecurity breaches in MHSs. Ad hoc, nonlinear interactions contribute to complexity and exacerbate the cybersecurity breach effects of complicatedness. In contrast, structured interactions, exemplified by patient data sharing through an EWDAP, achieve simplification and mitigate the cybersecurity breaches associated with complicatedness."
MISQ,2025,Regulating Digital Platform Ecosystems Through Data Sharing and Data Siloing: Consequences for Innovation and Welfare,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/9,"Digital platform ecosystems thrive on their ability to acquire and leverage user data across multiple data-driven services. This enables dominant platforms to harness insights obtained from their primary markets, where user data is collected, thus gaining a competitive advantage in secondary markets, where they exploit this data. While data cross-use brings about efficiencies, policymakers worldwide have expressed concerns about the economic power and the potential distortion of competition and innovation incentives associated with it. To address these concerns, two distinct and targeted policy interventions have been suggested: data siloing, which restricts the cross-use of data within platform ecosystems, and mandated data sharing with competitors. Using an analytical model that examines data cross-use in digital platform ecosystems, we analyzed the impact of data siloing and data sharing obligations, and their interaction on competition, innovation, consumer welfare, and overall social welfare. Our findings indicate that an optimal policy involves data sharing without data siloing, whereas the EU’s Digital Markets Act currently mandates both types of data cross-use regulation."
MISQ,2025,Regulating Emerging Technologies: Prospective Sensemaking through Abstraction and Elaboration,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/11,"Emerging digital technologies require regulation that will avoid harmful effects but that also, ideally, fosters innovation. We report on a case study of how actors, representing a variety of perspectives (legal, regulatory authority, government, industry, and technology), interacted to construct a law on trustworthy technology in the European state of Liechtenstein. This regulatory construction was enabled by collective prospective sensemaking relying on the interrelated processes of abstraction and elaboration, through which actors collectively reconceptualized the regulatory target in terms of the technology (from blockchain to trustworthy technology), its uses (from cryptocurrency to token economy), and required roles (from financial service provider roles to trustworthy technology systems roles). Abstraction allowed the group of actors to extract and generalize essential properties to support the regulatory goals of technology neutrality and innovation-friendliness. Elaboration allowed the group to identify and specify details and requirements to support the regulatory goals of creating legal certainty and protecting users. Through these processes, actors could construct a shared, collective understanding that accommodated various viewpoints and paved the way for writing a law. From this case study, we develop a theory of collective prospective sensemaking in regulating emerging technologies."
MISQ,2025,Do Crowds Validate False Data? Systematic Distortion and Affective Polarization,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/18,"This research note examines how sociocognitive influences can systematically distort crowdsourced ground truth in event-centric data through subgroups. The “wisdom of the crowd” is based on the assumption that consensus drives accuracy. While existing research addresses the tendencies of the overall crowd, this research note shows that identifiable subgroups within the crowd can systematically influence crowdsource validation. We conducted an immersive experiment to investigate whether crowd consensus can be systematically distorted by subgroup-based sociocognitive influences, such as affective polarization. In the experiment, raters from a range of subgroups with varying levels of affective polarization were asked to view and validate crisis data from a violent public riot in the year 2020. Relying in part on double debiased machine learning techniques, we analyzed heterogeneous treatment effects across subgroups. The results show that affective polarization and more extreme raters, via the constructs of loyalty and betrayal, distort consensus-based ground truth in different ways. This research note demonstrates how subgroup-based sociocognitive influences can systematically distort the results of consensus-based crowdsourced validation. Additionally, it provides guidance for research and practice on how to account for identifiable subgroups in the crowd. These findings challenge key assumptions about the wisdom of crowds and the accuracy of crowdsourced ground truth in event-centric situations."
MISQ,2025,How Mergers and Acquisitions Increase Data Breaches: A Complexity Perspective,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/13,"This study examines how the mergers and acquisitions (M&As) of a firm influence its number of data breaches. Drawing from complexity theory and matching theory, we propose that M&As increase data breaches and this effect is contingent on M&A diversity (dissimilarity between the parent and target firms). Based on the 18-year panel data (2004-2021) of 5,072 public firms in the United States, we find that more M&As by a firm lead to more data breaches. Moreover, we reveal that the number of data breaches increases even more when the parent and target firms operate in different business domains. This finding is confirmed when we operationalize M&A diversity as size discrepancy or a strategic type difference between the parent firm and the target firm (vertical vs. horizontal M&A). Furthermore, based on routine activity theory, we explore two additional moderating mechanisms through which M&As influence data breaches: M&A media publicity and target vulnerability. Our analyses demonstrate that M&As with higher media publicity experience more data breaches than those with lower media publicity, but counterintuitively, M&As involving a more vulnerable target firm lead to fewer data breaches than those involving a less vulnerable target firm. This study not only confirms the impact of M&As on data breach recurrence but also unveils various underlying mechanisms of this impact, thus contributing to both research and practice in cybersecurity and information systems."

MISQ,2025,Self-Organization and Governance in Digital Platform Ecosystems: An Information Ecology Approach,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/8,"This research investigates the interplay of top-down control and bottom-up self-organization within digital platform ecosystems (DPEs), focusing on the formation and management of complementor coalitions. Although these coalitions can increase a DPE’s generativity, they can also threaten its integrity. We investigate this tension by employing information ecology (IE) theory, which allows us to examine complementor coalitions as holons that navigate between self-assertiveness and integration within the structural hierarchies of DPEs. Utilizing an inductive, embedded case-study approach, we analyze the interplay between top-down control exerted by platform owners and the bottom-up self-organization of complementors in two enterprise software platform ecosystems. Our findings identify three distinct interaction modes—mandated, supported, and autonomous self-organization—each presenting hierarchical trade-offs between platform owner control and complementor autonomy. Our findings extend the prevalent owner-centric theory of platform governance by highlighting the significant impact of bottom-up self-organization on the governance and evolution of DPEs. We propose an integrated theory that accommodates these new dynamics, suggesting soft power as an effective governance mechanism. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the complexities in governing DPEs and offers practical insights for managing top-down control and bottom-up self-organization in the evolving landscape of enterprise software DPEs."
MISQ,2025,The Dark Side of Voluntary Data Sharing,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss1/10,"To balance the need for privacy and the benefits of big data analytics, regulators around the world are giving consumers control over their data, allowing them to choose whether or not to voluntarily share their purchase history data with firms. Intuition suggests that voluntary data sharing benefits consumers who can now choose to share their data only when it is profitable to do so. To investigate this argument, we built a model in which a monopolistic firm sells a repeatedly purchased product to consumers over two periods, and consumers decide whether or not to share their purchase history data with the firm, who can use it in the future to price-discriminate against them. We found that, compared to when data collection is completely outlawed, voluntary data sharing can benefit the firm but at the consumer’s expense. Moreover, regulations that mandate firms to better protect consumer data against data breaches can backfire on consumers. Finally, we show that under voluntary data sharing, a firm’s ability to offer consumers a monetary incentive to share their data can improve profits without hurting consumers. Taken together, these findings underscore the surprising effects of voluntary data sharing and caution public policymakers of how certain data policies that, on the surface, seem purely beneficial can lead to unintended consequences."

MISQ,2025,Design Principles for Information Categorization Quality in Crowdsourced Crisis Mapping Platforms,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/18,"Crisis mapping platforms have transformed disaster management and digital humanitarian efforts by allowing victims to quickly submit “Requests for Help” (RFH) messages directly from disaster locations via mobile devices. On these platforms, online volunteers are often engaged in processing and categorizing messy and incomplete RFH messages into structured and useful crisis reports that can aid first responders in their recovery efforts. This research note examines the case of the Ushahidi platform deployed during the 2010 Haiti Earthquake to propose design principles for a crisis mapping platform that facilitates the conversion and categorization of victim-submitted RFH messages into actionable crisis reports for on-site first responders. To validate the proposed design principles, we instantiated them with the help of a template, and conducted a series of experiments to confirm the effectiveness of the template in improving the categorization quality of crisis reports. We expect that the design principles will be particularly useful for developing digital platforms aimed at humanitarian crisis response that requires a large-scale participation of online crowd volunteers."
MISQ,2025,Social Norm Awareness and Norm Compliance in Online Games,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/10,"Online games are one of the most popular information systems in the world, with over 2 billion users worldwide. Most users follow the social norms and standards of behavior in online games, but some violate social norms, negatively affecting others’ gameplay experiences and weakening loyalty to the game. The social norms in games and other online environments often differ from the social norms in the real world, so are users who violate norms doing so deliberately or are they unaware of the norms? Our results suggest that many users violate social norms because they do not understand them—about a third of the 1,093 participants in our study reported being unsure of the social norms in an online game they played regularly. Greater experience with a game did not significantly increase social norm awareness. Instead, perceptions of social presence, and learning routines (i.e., community learning and instructional support) influenced social norm awareness, which in turn influenced norm compliance. Thus, a technology’s social affordances, social presence, and learning routines are more important than experience using a technology for helping users become aware of and comply with social norms."

MISQ,2025,The Hidden Cost of IT Innovation: Access to Emerging Technologies and the Gender Wage Gap,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/14,"Although an extensive information systems literature has explored the economic benefits of information technology (IT) investments, how these benefits are distributed between male and female IT workers has not been as closely examined. This paper bridges this gap by addressing two questions: (1) Do women and men have similar opportunities to acquire skills related to new IT innovations? (2) How do these differences affect the gender pay gap? We argue that women are underrepresented in roles that use emerging technologies due to two interrelated processes: demand-side labor market conditions and supply-side job sorting. By analyzing two independent datasets that provide insights into wages, career trajectories, and skill prerequisites for IT roles, we found that women are less likely to apply for jobs requiring expertise with emerging technologies. Such positions often require extended work hours, frequent job mobility, and geographic relocation—which can conflict with the family responsibilities typically assumed by women. Yet because these positions tend to offer higher wages, women’s underrepresentation in these roles exacerbates the gender pay gap in the IT sector. Our findings stress the importance of creating more flexible job structures and enhancing women’s access to emerging technology roles as critical for achieving gender equity in the IT industry."
MISQ,2025,Advancing Understanding of Scaling Health Information Infrastructures: Learning from EHR Initiatives in England,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/17,"Many countries are developing health information infrastructures (HII) such as integrated electronic health records (EHRs) as a means of improving healthcare efficiency and effectiveness. However, efforts to build and scale up HII are fraught with challenges, as exemplified by the well-known case of the National Health Service (NHS) in England. In particular, HII scaling initiatives give rise to tensions, such as across geographical boundaries of EHRs, which are often not effectively addressed in practice. At the same time, there have been calls for research on scaling IS through a practice perspective, which adds to the existing categorical analysis of scale. Thus motivated, we aim to conceptualize the scaling of HII, focusing on the tensions between scales, the practices to accomplish scaling, and their consequences for scaling outcomes. To do so, we undertook a case study of recent NHS efforts to integrate EHRs in England, where we analyzed these scalar concepts and their interrelationships. Our study further develops the notion that scaling not only involves increasing the scale of IS but entails constructing and reconstructing scales. We also offer theoretical contributions by conceptualizing the range of scalar tensions and practices, their interplay, and their influences on HII scaling outcomes. Tensions that we identify as associated with different scale boundaries (organizational, spatial, and technological), extend those recognized in prior research. Furthermore, we uncover the scalar practices of joining and differentiating, adding to the governance and architectural approaches for HII scaling examined in past work. Through deepening the understanding of HII scaling, we generate insights for practitioners by highlighting scalar tensions and practices that could address the tensions under different conditions. Overall, we draw attention to scaling phenomena as being integral to the development of HII and introduce a new vocabulary for thinking about HII scaling."

MISQ,2025,How Artifact-Based and Authority-Based Coordination Affect Propagation Costs in Open Source Software Development,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/19,"The success of open source software (OSS) projects depends on their ability to produce software architectures with low propagation costs, as such architectures demand little effort from developers. This study focuses on the project’s form of coordination—the way in which interdependent contributions are managed—as a driving force behind propagation costs. It distinguishes between two coordination archetypes. First, artifact-based coordination is found in egalitarian projects, in which developers only use the work artifact (the architecture itself), without direct interaction, to coordinate. Second, authority-based coordination is used in hierarchical projects (e.g., Linux Kernel) or when companies pay developers for their work. Using a computational model, this study compares these two coordination mechanisms by simulating how they build software architectures (formalized as design structure matrices) from interdependent contributions. As a contextual condition, the model considers the degree of architecture visibility, which is the developers’ (in)ability to see recent additions to the architecture. The model provides two insights. First, artifact-based coordination, as compared to authority-based coordination, generally leads to lower propagation costs. Second, decreasing the degree of architecture visibility reduces propagation costs, an effect that I describe as focal-layered superposition. These insights contribute to the literatures on coordination in OSS development and the mirroring hypothesis. They also have practical implications for the creation of preferable architectures in OSS development."
MISQ,2025,Understanding the Effectiveness of Rewarding Recipients on Online Referral Behavior,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/8,"Online referral programs predominantly focus on incentivizing referrers to make referrals but largely ignore the potential of rewarding recipients to motivate referral behaviors. In this paper, we systematically examine whether, how, and when rewarding recipients could effectively motivate referrers with five experiments across a variety of settings. The results demonstrate that rewarding recipients is effective in motivating referrers to behave prosocially and make referrals. Interestingly, referrers behave prosocially when they are not rewarded, but the effectiveness of rewarding recipients is reduced if referrers are rewarded. We also reveal that referrers’ prosocial behaviors are primarily driven by altruistic motivation, rather than the pursuit of either reputational or collective benefits; notably, offering rewards to referrers dampens their altruistic motivation. Finally, we find that referrers’ prosocial behaviors are inhibited with an increased action cost of their referral behaviors, while their prosocial behaviors persist, even with an increased interpersonal cost associated with the referral behaviors. We conclude by offering theoretical and managerial implications for designing effective referral strategies that leverage the potential of rewarding recipients."
MISQ,2025,Supporting Community First Responders in Aging in Place: An Action Design for a Community-Based Smart Activity Monitoring System,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/15,"To maintain elderly individuals’ ability to live independently in their own homes, technologies such as sensors and the internet of things can be used to facilitate real-time monitoring and automate emergency detection and alerts to enable first responders to deliver help on time. This study examines the design problems associated with such activity monitoring systems, particularly how to support the situational awareness of community first responders who are located remotely and do not have professional healthcare knowledge. Based on a three-year action design research study that investigated a sensor-based monitoring system for elderly people deployed in a natural community setting, we developed abstract design knowledge. Four design principles aimed at enhancing responders’ perceptions, comprehension, and projection of information are proposed to promote informed decision-making and timely responses by drawing on the situational awareness model. In addition to the nascent design knowledge regarding remote activity monitoring in different instances, this study extends our knowledge of the community-based model by foregrounding its multiplicity and the active roles of community stakeholders in providing care to elderly people."
MISQ,2025,"Causal Inference Grounded in Causal Diagrams: Benefits, Limitations, and Opportunities for the Information Systems Field",https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/5,"We join the important effort of embracing diverse views on causality reflected in a prior MIS Quarterly Editor’s Comment (Mithas et al., 2022b). Specifically, we aim to expand the discussion around a major causal framework and toolkit that, we believe, is largely missing and needed in empirical studies in the field of information systems: that of causal diagrams and structural causal modeling (SCM). Being relatively new, the SCM framework has faced resistance from economists that has only recently begun to soften and, for this reason, remains largely absent in econometrics textbooks and in the curriculum of most information systems PhD programs. In contrast to viewpoints emphasizing the dichotomy between SCM and econometrics or potential outcomes approaches, we explain how SCM can serve as a complementary layer of identification and communication that aligns with such proven design and analysis frameworks. We discuss the current limitations of the SCM framework and opportunities for new research."
MISQ,2025,Emergence of IT Implementation Consequences in Organizations: An Assemblage Approach,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/13,"Ex nihilo nihil fit—nothing comes from nothing—fundamentally challenges IS scholars to explain how a new behavior may emerge and evolve into a recognizable practice from an organization’s IT implementation processes. Prior research addressing this problem has ascribed consequences to a preexisting macrolevel structure or microlevel interactions. We examined this issue by conceptualizing the emergence of IT implementation consequences as a multiphased process with analytically disaggregated phases. Using an assemblage lens, our theorizing draws on data from a multisite case study of body-worn camera technology implementation in three municipal police organizations in the U.S. We identified three emergence phases—individuation, composition, and actualization—and developed a process model theorizing a path from material and expressive components to IT implementation consequences through cascading properties and capacities. Our model shows that the emergence of IT implementation consequences is nonlinear and involves feedback loops across multiple phases. In some instances, IT implementation consequences may emerge via negative feedback loops involving tweaks and course correction before converging into recognizable new practices. In other instances, they may fail or convergence into recognizable practices may be delayed. We also show how combining existing components and assemblages results in nesting assemblages at successively larger scales. This allowed us to relativize the micro-macro relationship and explain both top-down and bottom-up emergence of IT implementation consequences."
MISQ,2025,How Collaboration Technology Use Affects IT Project Team Creativity: Integrating Team Knowledge and Creative Synthesis Perspectives,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/12,"Contemporary IT project teams engage in creative problem solving to address increasingly complex business problems, highlighting the need to promote IT project team creativity. Collaboration technologies are widely used in IT project teams, but little is known about what collaboration technology features can be used to improve IT project team creativity and what the underlying influencing mechanisms are. To address this important gap, the current study builds on the extended team knowledge framework to identify collaboration technology features and decodes their influencing mechanisms on IT project team creativity by drawing on the novel creative synthesis theory originating in the management literature to the IT project team context. We identify three sets of collaboration technology support features—awareness knowledge supports, long-term knowledge supports, and transitional knowledge supports—and posit that their use can improve IT project team creativity by facilitating the creative synthesis process, which includes the three subconstructs of collective attention, similarity building, and enacting ideas. The research model is supported in general by empirical data collected through a multisourced survey of over 500 team members and their leaders from 62 IT project teams. We conclude with a discussion of theoretical and practical implications."

MISQ,2025,Behavior Toward Newcomers and Contributions to Online Communities,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/16,"In this paper, we study whether and how behavior toward newcomers impacts their socialization outcomes in terms of retention and the quality of contributions in online communities. By exploiting a natural experiment on a large deal-sharing platform, we found that an intervention that proactively reminds other community members to be more considerate of newcomers caused newcomer deals to receive 54% more comments and increased the positive sentiment of the comments. The newcomers in the treatment group were 10% more likely than newcomers in the non-treatment group to post another deal, suggesting an increase in retention. However, we did not observe any effect of the intervention on the quality of subsequent contributions. Our evidence suggests that the intervention merely caused a temporary shock to newcomers’ first contributions but did not improve their learning or motivate greater effort in subsequent contributions. We draw implications on the design of socialization processes to help communities improve the retention and performance of newcomers."
MISQ,2025,Privacy Concerns and Data Donations: Do Societal Benefits Matter?,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/6,"Data donations, where individuals are encouraged to donate their personal information, have the potential to advance medical research and help limit the spread of pandemics, among other benefits. The decision to donate data is fundamentally a privacy decision. In this research, we build on the privacy calculus, a model describing privacy risks and benefits, and examine the impact of privacy concerns on data donation decisions, highlighting the role of societal benefits in privacy decisions. Based on two randomized experiments using the general context of data donation for medical research (Experiment 1) and the specific context of data donation for COVID-19 research (Experiment 2), we find that individuals who are highly concerned about privacy tend to donate less data (Experiments 1 and 2). This effect holds under a variety of conditions and is consistent with prevailing research. However, this effect is contingent on the privacy calculus. When implicit or explicit societal benefits are perceived, particularly in the absence of privacy controls, the association between privacy concerns and data donation decisions is less salient, highlighting the significant role that societal benefits play in privacy decisions. We discuss the theoretical, practical, social, and ethical implications of these findings."
MISQ,2025,Defending Your Own or Trolling the Haters: A Configurational Approach to Incivility in Online Communities,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/11,"This study explores the emergence of incivility in online communities, challenging the traditional perspective that attributes incivility to individual elements of sociotechnical systems. We argue that this narrow focus fails to recognize the complex interactions between these elements, leading to a rudimentary understanding of how incivility originates and evolves. To address this gap, our research employed fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), examining approximately 4.3 million posts from 100 diverse online communities on Reddit. Through this analysis, we identified five distinct paths that converged into two primary community configurations: close-knit and scattered communities. Each configuration exhibits unique affordances whose activation fosters incivility in different ways. Based on these findings, we expand the understanding of incivility to include subtle, indirect behaviors beyond overt forms such as trolling or hate speech and show how the interplay of multiple community elements produces affordances, avoiding the narrow view of individual affordances and shedding light on variations of social systems. Finally, we demonstrate that within the same digital platform, different social systems can impact user behaviors, including incivility."
MISQ,2025,Popularity Feedback and Adaptation Strategies in Online Dating: A Social Comparison Perspective,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/9,"Digital platforms are increasingly employing informational nudges to motivate user participation. This paper examines the provision of popularity information as a feedback mechanism and its impact on users’ adaptation strategies. Leveraging ego utility theory and self-determination theory, we hypothesize that comparative popularity information—information that facilitates social comparison—will trigger different reactions based on gender and popularity level. In collaboration with an online dating service provider, we designed and conducted two randomized field experiments in which we provided popularity feedback to platform users and investigated their post-feedback behavioral changes in two adaptation strategies: the selectiveness in choosing potential partners (i.e., selectivity calibration) and the frequency of their online profile modifications (i.e., self-marketing). In the first experiment, where we revealed information about their popularity relative to other users, we found that those who received low-popularity feedback significantly increased self-marketing efforts and lowered their selectivity, but the opposite was observed in individuals who received high-popularity feedback. We also found that men readily made adaptations to their selectivity calibration and self-marketing, whereas women’s behaviors were more persistent as they exhibited little strategic change. We then conducted a second experiment in which we revealed absolute popularity instead of comparative popularity and observed no significant changes in adaptation strategies. Comparing the outcomes of the two experiments, we argue that it is the social comparison information associated with comparative popularity that drives user behavioral changes."
MISQ,2025,Breached and Denied: The Cost of Data Breaches on Individuals as Mortgage Application Denials,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss2/7,"While a large body of information systems (IS) literature has investigated the antecedents and consequences of data breaches in organizations, we do not have a good understanding of whether a data breach has a material impact on individuals whose private information is compromised and how much damage it causes. We overcome empirical challenges in investigating the impact of data breaches on individual victims by utilizing a unique natural experimental setting that allows us to credibly identify treated and controlled populations—the breach of South Carolina (SC) taxpayer records in 2012. With residents in SC as the treatment group and those in Georgia and North Carolina as the control group, our difference-in-differences estimations find that after the breach at the SC Department of Revenue, there was a significant increase in denials to SC residents’ residential mortgage applications for refinance and home improvement. We also find that the adverse impact of the breach was more profound for Black and Hispanic residents. Our study provides significant theoretical and policy implications with respect to the harm and costs of a large-scale data breach."
MISQ,2025,Augmented Reality at Work: Attention Management and Its Impact on Work Performance,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/10,"Augmented reality (AR) is rapidly emerging as a transformative display technology, blending computer-generated content with the real-world environment in real time. Using divided attention theory, this study investigates how different information delivery channels (i.e., AR vs. mobile phone) and the nature of information (i.e., dependence on specific physical context and complexity) affect work performance. A field experiment in the aircraft maintenance context demonstrates that the effect on work performance of providing information via AR vs. a mobile phone is mediated by work attentiveness. The findings reveal that the effectiveness of AR is particularly pronounced when information is highly dependent on the specific physical context but diminishes when information complexity is high. This research deepens our understanding of how presenting information directly in front of users’ eyes (i.e., via AR) affects their attention management and work performance. The findings have significant implications for firms in terms of how to leverage AR to enhance work performance in industrial settings."
MISQ,2025,The Complementor’s Dilemma: Navigating Growth Ambitions and the Dependency on Focal Actors in Platform Ecosystems,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/14,"The literature on platform ecosystems increasingly recognizes that nonfocal actors such as complementors may have growth ambitions. Such ambitions, if successfully advanced, may even elevate the complementor’s position in the platform ecosystem to that of a focal actor. However, transitioning from nonfocal actor to focal actor is challenging. Along the way, the nonfocal actor may need to choose between the seemingly unfavorable alternatives of acting on its growth ambitions—risking losing the focal actors’ support needed for that growth—or relinquishing its ambitions to ensure the support of the focal actors continues. Referring to this phenomenon as the complementor’s dilemma, we unpack the process whereby a nonfocal actor can pursue growth ambitions while successfully managing relationships with the focal platforms in the ecosystem. To address this research problem, we conducted an in-depth, embedded case study of a Chinese short-form video platform, Douyin (known as TikTok outside of China), from its inception as a complement in 2016 to its establishment as a focal actor in 2018. During this two-year period, Douyin grew spectacularly from 0.75 million to 208.28 million users. We examined the process through which Douyin navigated the complementor’s dilemma multiple times within the confines of its dependency on Weibo and WeChat, the focal actors in China’s social network platform ecosystem. We contribute to the platform ecosystem literature by offering a process perspective that conceptualizes the complementor’s dilemma and theorizes how to navigate the dilemma when transitioning from a nonfocal actor to a focal actor in a platform ecosystem."
MISQ,2025,An Empirical Study of Strategic Opacity in Crowdsourced Evaluations,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/18,"Crowd-voting mechanisms are commonly used to implement scalable evaluations of crowdsourced creative submissions. Unfortunately, the use of crowd-voting also raises the potential for gaming and manipulation. Manipulation is problematic because (1) submitters’ motivation depends on their belief that the system is meritocratic, and (2) manipulated feedback may undermine learning, as submitters seek to learn from received evaluations and those of peers. In this work, we consider a design approach to addressing the issue, focusing on the notion of strategic opacity, i.e., purposefully obfuscating evaluation procedures. On the one hand, opacity may reduce the incentive and thus the prevalence of vote manipulation, and submitters may instead dedicate that time and effort to improving their submission quantity or quality. On the other hand, because opacity makes it difficult for submitters to discern the returns to legitimate effort, submitters may also reduce their submission effort or simply exit the market. We explored this tension via a multimethod study employing field experiments at 99designs and a controlled experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We observed consistent results across all experiments: opacity leads to reductions in gaming in these crowdsourcing contests and significant increases in the allocation of effort toward legitimate vs. illegitimate activities, with no discernible influence on contest participation. We discuss boundary conditions and the implications for contest organizers and contest platform operators."
MISQ,2025,"Automating in High-Expertise, Low-Label Environments: Evidence-Based Medicine by Expert-Augmented Few-Shot Learning",https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/12,"Many real-world process automation environments are rife with high-expertise and limited labeled data. We propose a computational design science artifact to automate systematic review (SR) in such an environment. SR is a manual process that collects and synthesizes data from medical literature to inform medical decisions and improve clinical practice. Existing machine learning solutions for SR automation suffer from a lack of labeled data and a misrepresentation of the high-expertise manual process. Motivated by humans’ impressive capability to learn from limited examples, we propose a principled and generalizable few-shot learning framework—FastSR—to automate the multistep, expertise-intensive SR process using minimal training data. Informed by SR experts’ annotation logic, FastSR extends the traditional few-shot learning framework by including (1) various representations to account for diverse SR knowledge, (2) attention mechanisms to reflect semantic correspondence of medical text fragments, and (3) shared representations to jointly learn interrelated tasks (i.e., sentence classification and sequence tagging). We instantiated and evaluated FastSR on three test beds: full-text articles from Wilson disease (WD) and COVID-19, as well as a public dataset (EBM-NLP) containing clinical trial abstracts on a wide range of diseases. Our experiments demonstrate that FastSR significantly outperforms several benchmarking solutions and expedites the SR project by up to 65%. We critically examine the SR outcomes and practical advantages of FastSR compared to other ML and manual SR solutions and propose a new FastSR-augmented protocol. Overall, our multifaceted evaluation quantitatively and qualitatively underscores the efficacy and applicability of FastSR in expediting SR. Our results have important implications for designing computational artifacts for automating/augmenting processes in high-expertise, low-label environments."
MISQ,2025,Find the Good. Seek the Unity: A Hidden Markov Model of Human-AI Delegation Dynamics,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/17,"As AI becomes integral to enterprise decision-making, this study explores the collaborative dynamics between managers and AI systems, focusing on human willingness to delegate tasks to AI. Grounded in the “agentic” systems delegation framework and instance-based learning theory, we employed a hidden Markov model in a longitudinal study of the dynamic delegation decision-making process involving 875 store managers. We found that there is a potential polarization in managers’ delegation willingness, with managers who recognize the capability of AI exhibiting high delegation willingness and fostering increased collaboration with AI over time—in contrast to their counterparts who are inclined to reduce AI’s involvement. During human-AI interactions, managers’ continuous performance appraisal of AI shapes their dynamic delegation willingness, which in turn affects their assessment of AI capability. This process forms a delegation feedback loop that drives the dynamics of delegation behaviors. Our study indicates that managers with a high willingness to delegate tend to outperform their counterparts and offers valuable insights for human-AI collaborative intelligence in organizational settings."

MISQ,2025,Dancing to the #Challenge: The Effect of TikTok on Closing the Artist Gender Gap in the Music Industry,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/6,"This study investigates how “Hashtag Dance Challenges” (HDCs), a phenomenon popularized on the short-video platform TikTok, are instrumental in helping music artists gain traction in the digital music marketplace. HDCs represent an appealing combination of music and dance, designed to engage users and achieve virality, thereby benefiting artists whose music is featured. This research focuses on how HDCs contribute to the success of women artists, as compared to men, in an industry known for its diversity but challenged by gender inclusivity. We apply role congruity theory to posit that women artists are in a better position to derive benefits from being featured on HDCs, relative to male artists, particularly in cases of gender concordance—when both the creator and the artist are women. We measure the benefits of HDCs using daily changes in the artist’s followership on Spotify, a leading music streaming service, and test our hypotheses using song and artist-level data collected from Spotify and TikTok. We found that artists featured in a new HDC achieve a significant increase in followership on Spotify, relative to similar artists not featured in an HDC. Further, we observed that women creators drive this effect, enhancing the daily growth of Spotify followers by approximately 3% more for women artists, underscoring the value of gender concordance. Our findings shed light on the role of short videos, especially through the vehicle of HDCs, in advancing women artists, while also promoting inclusivity within the digital music industry."

One common issue behind many failing AI initiatives is that they are organized just like other information technology (IT) innovation efforts. To elucidate why and how the production of AI and IT innovations may need to be managed differently, this study juxtaposes these two types of innovations based on two key dimensions of the Schumpeterian framework: the form (product vs. process) and magnitude (radical vs. incremental) of innovations. By analyzing a matched sample of AI and IT patents, we found robust evidence that AI innovations are less radical and more process oriented than comparable IT innovations. Drawing upon our empirical discovery, we developed a conceptual framework to suggest a new way to think about organizing AI innovation. Our research contributes to the literature and practice on AI innovation by illuminating the comparative differences between AI innovations and other IT innovations and advancing a set of empirically derived propositions on how firms may be able to better manage their AI innovation activities."

MISQ,2025,Do Digital Platforms Improve the Performance of Nonbinding Contracts? Evidence from the Amazon Freight Platform,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/7,"This research examines how digital platforms influence the performance of nonbinding contracts. Businesses in many industries with high uncertainty, such as trucking freight and construction, simultaneously use nonbinding contracts, which impose no legal sanctions for refusals, and spot markets, which facilitate real-time, flexible transactions with market-determined prices. Understanding the conditions under which nonbinding contracts perform is a major concern in these industries. Leveraging the entry of the Amazon Freight platform in the trucking freight industry, we demonstrate that adding a digital platform-enabled spot marketplace improves the performance of nonbinding contracts. We identified several mechanisms driving this effect: (1) expanding carriers’ transportation capacity, (2) lowering spot market prices, and (3) reducing shippers’ reliance on nonbinding contracts for shorter-haul truckloads. Moreover, the digital platform’s impact on enhancing nonbinding contract performance is particularly pronounced in markets with volatile demand and shorter hauls. This research contributes to understanding the impacts of digital platforms in highly uncertain industries that simultaneously use nonbinding contracts and spot markets.

We propose that while EHR adoption reduces the likelihood of claim denials by improving the accuracy and completeness of information processing, it can also increase claim denials if EHR applications are sourced from multiple vendors within a hospital or different vendors across hospitals. Using a large-scale dataset of claim records from the state of Maryland from 2012-2016, we found that the greater the EHR adoption by care providers, the less likely a claim is denied. In addition, our findings suggest that EHRs are more effective in preventing denials when a hospital sources EHR applications from a single vendor and when a group of hospitals in the same health system sources EHRs from the same vendor. Additionally, we observed a decrease in claim denials when physicians previously worked in hospitals utilizing EHR applications from the same vendor. This study provides significant theoretical insights into the information systems literature on HIT and offers practical implications for healthcare providers by uncovering the multifaceted roles of EHRs in information processing and compliance."
MISQ,2025,Fake News and True News Assessment: The Persuasive Effect of Discursive Evidence in Judging Veracity,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/5,"Individuals are often unable to assess the veracity of news claims—especially on social media platforms. Recent research has suggested that interventions indicating normative signals, such as flagging false claims, are not always effective. We propose an approach in which users are provided with discursive evidence to consider in determining the veracity of claims rather than depending on normative true or false flags. We conducted a series of experiments to explore the effects of different forms of discursive evidence on individual judgments of the veracity of news claims. We found that providing such evidence can significantly improve individuals’ judgment of both true and false news claims—with certain caveats. Providing discursive evidence with high evidence strength leads to a general increase in veracity judgment. Discursive evidence containing items with lower evidence strength may shift believability—thus improving judgments for either true or false claims but degrading them for the other. We also identify important asymmetries between true and false claims, finding that the effect of some evidence may be improved if people are in a more critical mindset—for example, by priming them to think about the concept of truth and lies. Taken together, these results extend knowledge on the problem of fake news and may suggest effective approaches to address the problem without diminishing attention to true news."
MISQ,2025,Does Ransomware Make Investors “WannaCry”? On Investors’ Divergent Reactions to Ransomware Hits and Near Misses,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/15,"In recent years, ransomware has become one of the most dangerous cyber threats, with successful attacks causing severe operational disruptions and staggering damages. Rationally speaking, investors should react negatively to firms’ ransomware disclosures, but this may not always be the case. Based on norm theory, we describe a paradoxical phenomenon wherein investors exhibit negative reactions to ransomware hits (i.e., events that led to operational disruptions) but positive reactions to near misses (i.e., events in which operational disruptions were narrowly avoided). The positive reactions occur due to an outcome bias in which near-miss events—events that are objectively negative but less severe than expected—are viewed positively instead of negatively. We tested these predictions by reporting on an investigation of stock market reactions to disclosures of ransomware hits vs. near misses. To do so, we assembled a comprehensive dataset of ransomware incidents disclosed by U.S. public firms. Using the event study method, we estimated abnormal stock market returns and found evidence in support of our predictions. First, in line with expectations, ransomware hits that led to the expected severe impact resulted in stock price drops of -4.40%. However, near misses, where disruptions were avoided, were rewarded with gains of 2.87%, confirming positive instead of negative reactions. This offers new insights into investors’ biased responses to certain cybersecurity incidents. These positive reactions, however, represent a call for caution because, albeit seemingly favorable, they mask underlying risks."
MISQ,2025,Engaging Physicians with Introductory Incentives: References to Online and Offline Income,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/8,"Incentives make or break user contributions. While providing introductory incentives to attract new users has become increasingly popular among online communities, their impact on user contributions remains largely unknown. Utilizing a policy change that doubled the incentives paid to physicians in a leading online health community, we examined the impacts of both the initiation and the termination of such introductory incentives on physician contributions (in terms of patient consultations) and how the impacts varied according to the physician’s online and offline income. We found that despite an increase in physician contributions during the policy window, the introductory incentives unintentionally decreased physician contributions after the policy window ended. Additionally, physicians tended to anchor their contributions using their online rather than offline income as a reference point, suggesting that mental accounting was at play. Our findings provide a cautionary perspective on the unintended consequences of using introductory incentives and reveal the associated mechanisms of mental accounting when users make contributions (or not) to online communities. These findings provide important implications for incentive design and user engagement in online communities."
MISQ,2025,Producing the “We” in High-Risk Online Activism: Identity Configurations in My Stealthy Freedom,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/9,"The research on online social movements generally concludes that collective identity, i.e., the sense of we-ness that individual protesters in a movement share, is not only unattainable but also dispensable, even though it is considered a defining feature of traditional movements. In this paper, we explore one of the boundary conditions of these findings, namely the riskiness of protest practices. Analysing the high-risk social movement, My Stealthy Freedom (MySF), which contests compulsory hijab in Iran in a way that hybridizes online and offline protest practices, we show that a sense of collectiveness can be instantiated in online social movements, why it is critical to the success of high-risk activism, and how it is (re)produced. Comparing and contrasting three instantiations of MySF, each of which was enacted on a different social media platform, we develop a theoretical model of how feelings of collectiveness are enacted in high-risk online activism. In addition to providing guidance for online movements where collective identity is desirable, our study challenges prior research on online activism by theorizing the role of embodiment, affect, and the dialectic between activists’ personal and the movement’s collective identity."
MISQ,2025,"Information Technology Firms and Revenue Stall, 1950-2015: Theory and Empirical Evidence",https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/19,"A slowdown in revenue growth, referred to as revenue stall in this study, is a key concern for any firm. We examine how information technology-producing firms (i.e., IT firms) differ from non-IT firms in experiencing revenue stall and in benefiting from R&D investments in terms of reduced revenue stall. We hypothesize that whereas IT firms experience more revenue stall than non-IT firms, R&D investments reduce revenue stall to a greater extent in IT firms than in non-IT firms. Our empirical analyses of a longitudinal dataset of more than 1,400 large public firms in the United States from 1950 to 2015 broadly support our hypotheses. Consistent with the theoretical arguments underlying our hypotheses, we also find that IT firms experience higher competition, dynamism, and turbulence, and have higher intangible assets than non-IT firms."
MISQ,2025,Mobile Advertising in Distracted Environments: Exploring the Impact of Distractions on Dual-Task Interference,https://aisel.aisnet.org/misq/vol49/iss3/11,"It is increasingly common for consumers to engage with various tasks on their personal devices amid other distractions such as watching television at home, shopping at malls, or attending concerts. While this split in attention poses challenges, it also opens valuable opportunities for advertisers to strategically push targeted advertisements based on information about the user’s environment. Across a series of controlled lab experiments using a custom app developed for this study, we demonstrate how marketers can optimize pop-up advertising on consumers’ personal devices within distraction-filled environments. In doing so, we extend traditional insights from dual-task interference studies that have previously focused on corresponding tasks in isolation, without considering any stimuli from the environment. Our results indicate that, in the presence of additional stimuli from the environment, a facilitating relationship exists between the attention paid to a task and the effectiveness of pop-up advertisements interrupting the task. However, this relationship is moderated by the extent of attention diffusion from the environment. As the distance between the task and the environment increases, consumer attention to the task is more diffused, resulting in poorer encoding of the pop-up advertisements. Critically, optimizing the content and timing of pop-up advertisements to the environmental content can significantly improve their effectiveness. Our results have important implications for helping marketers develop actionable strategies for mobile advertising in distraction-filled environments."

MMIS,2025,Hate Speech Detection on Online News Platforms: A Deep-Learning Approach Based on Agenda-Setting Theory,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2520173,"Hate speech on online news platforms has emerged as a critical societal challenge, influencing public discourse and impacting industries. However, existing detection methods often fail to capture its contextual nature and are grounded in weak theoretical foundations. To address this gap, we integrate agenda-setting theory with design science paradigms to develop a deep learning model for detecting hate speech on online news platforms. Leveraging bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), our model analyzes the interplay between news headlines, texts, and user comments, capturing both media issue salience and emotional agenda-setting effects. Empirical validation demonstrates that our model outperforms traditional baselines in hate speech detection and topic classification tasks. This contextualized approach enhances prediction accuracy, explainability, and domain adaptability, contributing to improved performance and broader applicability. Our study makes theoretical and methodological contributions to Information Systems research and offers practical insights for implementing ethical, real-time hate speech detection strategies."
MMIS,2025,Can Correction Messages Reduce the Spread of Fake News on Social Media? The Impact of Information Updates on the Effectiveness of Corrections,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2520174,"Although government agencies and fact-checking organizations issue correction messages to mitigate misinformation dissemination on social media, their efforts have been largely ineffective. Drawing on Information Manipulation Theory (IMT) and information extracted from over 84 million tweets, we examine the impact of correction messages and explore how different information updates affect their effectiveness. Our empirical approach differentiates between subpopulations of correction messages. The results support the existence of two distinct types: correction messages that significantly mitigate the spread of fake news—a 1 percent increase in “effective” messages decreases the spread of fake news by 0.89 percent; and those that amplify the misinformation—a 1 percent increase in “ineffective” messages increases the spread of fake news by 1.37 percent. Despite the higher count of “effective” correction messages, they are less potent than their “ineffective” counterparts. Our study extends the tenets of IMT to correction messages to identify effective platform interventions and highlight the efficacy of information updates in reducing the spread of fake news. Furthermore, it offers significant insights to social media platforms and fact-checking organizations on designing and deploying effective corrections."

This study, grounded in the sociotechnical and social learning perspectives, examines the drivers and outcomes of social learning in ideologically charged firestorms, which represent an emerging form. We investigate the effects of social consensus and message persuasiveness, platform content centricity, and individual–firm relationship closeness on the social learning of negative eWOM behavior and purchase behavior. Two studies, comprising longitudinal quantitative and qualitative surveys, were conducted. The results indicate that message persuasiveness is strongly associated with the social learning of negative eWOM behavior. Negative eWOM behavior subsequently influences post-firestorm purchasing behavior. The moderating effects of platform content centricity and individual–firm relationship closeness are discussed. These findings advance the literature and offer practitioners actionable insights into managing digital crises."
MMIS,2025,"Boundary Morphing: Causes, Consequences, and Architectural Levers",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2520179,"We study how app competitiveness evolves through intertemporal shifts between proprietary code and platform-sourced functionality. We introduce the novel mechanism ofboundary morphing—apps expanding their boundaries by adding proprietary code or contracting them by increasing platform-sourced functionality—by integrating transaction cost economics (TCE) with platforms theory. Using seven years of data from over 600 AndroidOS apps, we show that platform specificity and market uncertainty drive boundary contraction, while frequent updates counterintuitively catalyze boundary expansion. App modularity—acting as a shift parameter—reshapes this calculus, enabling boundary expansion amid uncertainty and rapid updates. We contribute: (1) boundary morphing as a mechanism to straddle synergy-differentiation tradeoffs, (2) IS-native insights in a TCE scaffold to explain morphing, and (3) modularity’s role in reshaping it. Together, these findings explain how apps morph boundaries as an architectural lever to stay competitive."
MMIS,2025,Algorithmic Stakeholder Governance on Content Platforms: A Lead Role Perspective,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2520177,"Algorithmic governance is not enough on its own to manage and protect the interests of multiple stakeholders. Therefore, platforms are increasingly seeking to involve stakeholders in their algorithmic governance, synthesizing the domains of algorithmic governance and stakeholder governance. We denote this synthesis asalgorithmic stakeholder governance. In this paper, we examine algorithmic stakeholder governance in the context of content platforms focusing on the algorithmically mediated interactions among three key stakeholders—creators, consumers, and advertisers. We explore this topic by conducting an in-depth study of the YouTube platform. Using grounded theory techniques, we generate a model that explains the process by which platform stakeholder interactions are algorithmically governed to address key stakeholder conflicts related to free speech, information diversity, and content safety. Our model suggests that algorithmic stakeholder governance provides a forum for resolving these stakeholder conflicts and theorizes the interplay between the platform’s approach to algorithmic stakeholder governance and stakeholder participation. Our research contributes primarily to the literature on platform governance and algorithmic governance on platforms more specifically, by shifting the focus from centralized control and viewing users as objects of governance towards a more decentralized and balanced perspective where platform users are viewed as active stakeholders."
MMIS,2025,Roles of Psychological Recovery Experiences and Visual Anonymity in Team-based Gamified Online Learning,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2520175,"Gamification has been widely adopted by businesses and educational institutions to drive desired user behaviors and performance. Despite its significance across industry, healthcare, and organizational contexts, its role in fostering psychological recovery experiences (PRE) remains underexplored. Grounded in gamification frameworks and literature on affordances and PRE, this study investigates the mediating role of PRE between gamification affordances and personal initiative. Additionally, we examine the moderating effect of perceived visual anonymity as a situational affordance in the relationship between gamification affordances and PRE. To test our hypotheses, we collected data from 682 graduate students enrolled in an enterprise resource planning (ERP) course (Study 1: 258; Study 2: 424). Our findings reveal that mastery and control experiences mediate the relationship between collaboration and feedback affordances and personal initiative. Furthermore, perceived visual anonymity negatively moderates the relationship between collaboration affordance and mastery and control experiences, while positively moderating the relationship between feedback affordance and control experience. This study highlights the importance of psychological recovery experiences and perceived visual anonymity in fostering personal initiative within gamified online learning environments."
MMIS,2025,Risk of Cyberattacks Arising from Strategic Alliances with Big Tech,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2520176,"This research theorizes and documents for the first time a cyber risk that may arise from strategic alliances with Big Tech, a grouping of the most dominant companies in the information technology industry. This research proposes that alliances with Big Tech tend to involve leveraging and integrating Big Tech’s innovative technological capabilities into a focal firm’s data management, operations, products, or services. This process can be understood as an inter-organizational system of systems integration and is presented as a mechanism that makes focal firms vulnerable to external cyberattacks. In addition, this research theorizes and shows that the effect of strategic alliances with Big Tech on the risk of cyberattacks is not linear; instead, it increases up to a certain point and then starts decreasing. Finally, this research suggests that intangible asset intensity strengthens the relationship between strategic alliances with Big Tech and the risk of cyberattacks. The findings of this research provide timely and important insights into cyber risks arising from strategic alliances centered on integrating systems and technologies across partner firms’ boundaries."

Using an eye-tracking experiment, it examines participants’ responses to conflicting ratings, with a focus on attention patterns and decision-making. Results reveal that signal discrepancies significantly reduce trust. Participants exhibit increased cognitive load when confronted with inconsistent signals, as evidenced by longer fixation times and more frequent transitions between ratings. These findings suggest that conflicting information demands greater cognitive effort. The study also highlights the differential effects of primary (native) and secondary (imported) signals, demonstrating that platform-specific reputational systems play a dominant role in trust-building. By offering insights into the relationship among conflicting signals, trust, and cognitive processing, the study provides a novel theoretical perspective on reputation portability and derives practical implications for complementors and platform operators."
MMIS,2025,Digital Skill Visibility and Job Promotion of Open Source Software Developers,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2520171,"Material to inform the decisions on the job promotion of open source software (OSS) developers is available on platforms. Digital features increase the visibility of OSS developer technical and interpersonal skills. Digital features also make it possible for OSS developers to visibly receive endorsements and recommendations from others about those skills. It is unclear how well the visibility of technical versus interpersonal skills through such digital features facilitates OSS developer job promotions. Leveraging Turner’s contest-sponsored mobility framework [66], we theorize and empirically examine these concerns using a sample of 269 OSS developers. We find that a developer making their technical skills visible on digital platforms is associated with job promotions. In contrast, the visibility of interpersonal skills through recommendations affects job promotions. Our findings contribute to theory and practice by providing a lens to understand the differential effects of technical versus interpersonal skill visibility offered by different digital features and their effect on OSS developer job promotions."
MMIS,2025,Impact of Non-Diagnostic Digital Services on Online Healthcare Consultation,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2520180,"The persistent preference of patients for well-known healthcare providers inevitably leads to demand imbalances within the healthcare sector. Luckily, our research reveals that online healthcare platforms (OHPs) can address this issue by offering non-diagnostic digital services. Using an OHP-based online prescribing service as an example, our study reveals that this non-diagnostic digital service has resulted in a significant increase in consultations, particularly for less prominent hospitals and junior physicians. This shift promotes a more equitable distribution of healthcare demand. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the balancing effect primarily arises from attracting low-uncertainty demand–consultations that focus less on diagnosis—and from fostering trust between patients and physicians. Our findings present a compelling information systems (IS) solution to the pressing issue of patient demand imbalance. By illustrating how a non-diagnostic digital solution can transform healthcare delivery and enhance resource allocation, we contribute to improved healthcare efficiency. This paper offers insights for researchers focused on OHP design and for health practitioners seeking to leverage digital solutions to manage demand."

MMIS,2025,Generative AI and its Transformative Value for Digital Platforms,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2487315,"The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) represents a watershed moment in the evolution of digital platforms. The capabilities of this AI technology go beyond traditional AI systems, enabling the autonomous generation of novel outcomes with significant implications for platform value creation, architecture, governance, and stakeholder interactions. We develop an integrative conceptual framework that identifies four key mechanisms through which GenAI transforms digital platforms: intelligent automation, democratization, hyper-personalization, and collaborative innovation. Through intelligent automation, GenAI transforms boundary resources from passive interfaces into active, intelligent mediators of value creation. Democratization systematically lowers barriers to platform participation. Hyper-personalization enables dynamic, individual-level adaptation of platform content. Collaborative innovation transforms platform innovation by making GenAI an active participant in human-AI value co-creation. We use this framework to situate the papers in the special issue and develop a research agenda that explores the transformative impact of GenAI on platform stakeholder relationships."

Although prior work found an overall decrease in knowledge seeking in online communities upon the availability of GenAI, the underlying dynamics across user groups have remained unexplored. This study addresses that gap. Drawing on commitment-based theory, we hypothesize that casual users—motivated by cost-benefit considerations—are more likely to reduce their question-posting activity than highly committed members. Using adifference-in-differencesanalysis, we find that ChatGPT’s arrival leads to a substantial drop in questions on StackExchange, primarily driven by casual users (about 18.2%). Motivated by information foraging theory, we reveal heterogeneous downstream effects of GenAI on question characteristics. In particular, we find that the questions by casual users become more complex and novel, while those by intensive and top users do not. These results highlight the importance of heterogeneous user motivations in shaping platform dynamics, underscoring that while GenAI may diminish overall participation, it may also increase the value of the remaining content. Our study offers insights for knowledge sharing communities, managers, and stakeholders reliant on user-generated data, providing a nuanced view of GenAI’s disruptive influence."
MMIS,2025,Shifting Dynamics: How Generative AI as a Boundary Resource Reshapes Digital Platform Governance,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2487312,"Digital platforms are increasingly integrating Generative AI (GenAI) tools as a boundary resource to enhance the quantity and quality of content with the ultimate goal of improving platform viability. As GenAI tools hold unique characteristics compared to traditional boundary resources, platform owners need to adapt their governance mechanisms accordingly. To understand how platform governance evolves over time in response to this novel boundary resource, we draw on the distributed tuning framework and build on insights from an in-depth qualitative study of a digital content platform in the educational sector. We find that the platform owner deployed different logics of GenAI integration over time that were enacted through specific governance mechanisms. The shift in logics and respective governance mechanisms was triggered by a dialectic process of resistance and accommodation between platform actors. In this process, the GenAI-enabled boundary resource not only changed over time but also served as a means for the power dynamics between platform owner and complementors to be reshaped. Our study contributes to both the platform governance literature as well as recent debates around GenAI."
MMIS,2025,Are You Willing to Pay for Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) Products? Disentangling the Disclosure Effects and the Mediating Role of Psychological Value,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2487314,"While digital platform vendors are rapidly offering new generative artificial intelligence products (GAIPs), prior research on algorithmic aversion suggests that users may not respond to them the same way as to the human-generated products (HGPs). We propose that GAIPs induce psychological value, defined as a user’s intrinsic desire for a product that can influence their willingness to pay and may depend on the product type. Disclosing a product as a GAIP or HGP could further influence user reactions. From our randomized experiments with three different products representing functional, hybrid, and creative product types, we find psychological value plays an important role in creative products, such as wall art. Human disclosure shows no effect on functional or highly creative products. Our study theoretically extends the algorithmic aversion literature by illustrating the role of psychological value in GAIP highlighting the nuanced role of product type and disclosure in influencing user reactions and offering practical implications."
MMIS,2025,Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)-Based Recommender Addressing Contribution Pollution and Information Cacophony on Digital Platforms,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2487311,"Digital platforms facilitate interactions among geographically distributed users which reinforce the positive network effects. However, a disproportionate increase in the contributions of users results in contribution pollution (disproportionate increase in users’ contributions) and information cacophony (incoherence of contributions). Unaddressed, contribution pollution and information cacophony challenges have negative implications for platform efficiency and users’ humanistic outcomes. This paper highlights the limitations of existing mechanisms and proposes a framework for a generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)–based recommender system. To evaluate the efficacy of the GenAI–based recommender system, we develop an agent-based simulation model and conduct experiments using real data from three platforms (Reddit, Hacker News, and Stack Overflow). This research contributes a novel sociotechnical framework that addresses the challenges of contribution pollution and information cacophony. For the governance of platforms, this research provides actionable guidance on the policy implications of integrating GenAI-based technologies for user- and platform-level outcomes."

For example, complementors lack standardized, reusable functionality that powers their applications and struggle to consistently generate desired outputs. To identify how complementors mitigate these challenges, we conducted an embedded case study of complementors in the OpenAI platform ecosystem. We identified four value co-creation mechanisms of embedded and stand-alone complements that mitigate the challenges: (1) utilizing system instructions, (2) providing context data, (3) curating user inputs, and (4) revising AI model outputs. Depending on the complement type, complementors employ these mechanisms, leverage synergies between mechanisms, and unlock previously not employable mechanisms. We contribute to research by revealing two novel logics—the reap logic and the differentiation logic—that explain how complementors co-create value by mitigating the challenges through the value co-creation mechanisms."
MMIS,2025,Effects of Nudging and Privacy Control on Online Physician Reviews: Evidence from a Field Experiment,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2487309,"Patients using healthcare services have substantial privacy concerns when writing online reviews of their physicians that may deter them from sharing information potentially helpful for others. This gives rise to a dilemma in which patients have to trade off between privacy and social welfare, leading to fewer and less informative reviews. To examine this trade off, we study how nudging strategies together with privacy control affect reviewers’ decisions related to the provision of reviews, disclosure of sensitive information, and identity revelation. We conducted a large-scale two-stage field experiment, complemented by lab experiments, to establish causality. Results reveal that nudging with an open appeal, compared to nudging with targeted benefits, increases the likelihood of patients submitting reviews. However, nudges that highlight benefits to self increase the proportion of patients revealing sensitive medical information in their reviews and the likelihood of them revealing their identity. Additionally, preemptive privacy control increases the likelihood of identity revelation without adversely impacting the sharing of sensitive information in reviews. Our findings highlight how nudging and privacy control influence patients’ review provision behavior. This study offers strategic implications for online platforms navigating the complex interplay of consumer motivations and privacy concerns in healthcare."
MMIS,2025,Job Crafting in the Context of Enterprise System Implementations,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2487305,"This paper examines employees’ job crafting in the context of enterprise system (ES) implementations. Job crafting refers to employees’ self-initiated changes aimed at improving their jobs. Drawing on self-construal and trait activation theories, we posit that personality traits associated with an independent self-construal (conscientiousness [CONSC] and openness [OPEN]) and an interdependent self-construal (agreeableness [AGREE] and extraversion [EXTRA]) promote and inhibit job crafting, respectively, with their effects moderated by ES-enabled opportunity (OPPT) and self-efficacy (SE). We further posit that job crafting increases job performance and job satisfaction. We tested our hypotheses with data from a public agency (n = 180) and a Fortune-1000 firm (n = 872). Results showed that personality traits, OPPT, and SE interacted to affect job crafting, which in turn increased job performance and job satisfaction. Our research underscores job crafting as a potent means for employees to effectively navigate ES implementations and sheds light on individual differences in job crafting motivation and behavior."
MMIS,2025,Understanding the Role of Technology in Coordination Through Affordance Configurations,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2487306,"Coordination of work activities through information exchange is fundamental and increasingly occurs over technology, yet breakdowns are frequent and lead to performance declines. Taking an episodic lens and applying configurational theorizing, we identify seven technology-enabled coordination affordances that facilitate enactment of coordination episodes. Given that coordination episodes often involve combinations of these affordances, we use qualitative comparative analysis (a technique used for configurational analysis) to identify affordance configurations associated with successful coordination. By analyzing our data and paying special attention to coordination breakdowns, we uncover how each configuration is suited to manage a specific type of coordination dependency (pooled, sequential, or kairotic). We contribute to the affordances literature by recognizing the relationship between first-order affordances, which are enabled by technology features, and affordance configurations (analogous to higher-level affordances). We contribute to coordination theory by providing new insights into how technology can augment human coordination and describe a new type of dependency (kairotic). Our work helps inform the design of systems to support coordination processes."
MMIS,2025,The Algorithm Discount: Explaining Consumers’ Valuation of Human- versus Algorithm-Created Digital Products,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2487308,"Owing to advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI), machines can now create digital products like software applications or media content, evoking calls to label such products as “AI-made.” Research on the handmade effect and algorithm aversion suggests that consumers react negatively to digital products that have been created by generative AI systems instead of humans. It is unclear why consumers show this reaction, which we refer to as “algorithm discount.” To answer this question, we conducted a mixed-methods study in the context of digital news offerings, comprising 41 qualitative interviews and a choice-based conjoint analysis with 421 respondents. The results show that consumers’ beliefs about the love and effort imbued in the product, their curiosity about algorithmically generated products, and specific product characteristics, such as the type of news article, determine the algorithm discount. These findings extend our understanding of the emergence of consumers’ aversion to algorithm-created products and offer providers of such products insight into potential countermeasures."

MMIS,2025,Long Live the Metaverse: Identifying the Potential for Market Disruption and Future Research,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2455770,"The Metaverse represents a transformative frontier, blending physical and virtual realities into immersive, persistent digital environments. This article explores the foundational components, emerging markets, and critical challenges shaping the Metaverse’s evolution. Although initial industry enthusiasm has been tempered by financial setbacks and shifting priorities toward generative artificial intelligence (AI), the Metaverse remains nascent, following a familiar hype cycle with other disruptive technologies. Drawing parallels with historical technological breakthroughs, we argue that continued hardware, software, and telecommunications advancements will unlock the Metaverse’s potential for profound societal and economic impact. We explore the potential for business approaches and collaborative efforts across various market sectors, including consumer goods and commercial services, as well as healthcare and industrial realms. To do so, we explain how technologies like virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and extended reality (XR) increase user participation through consuming content that creates a sense of presence while at the same time outlining Metaverse challenges, risks, technological difficulties, and sociotechnical factors. By dissecting specific use cases and proposing strategies for managing challenges like data privacy, security, and inclusivity, we chart a path for researchers and practitioners to foster innovation. The article concludes with a call to action for researchers to lead visionary efforts, urging them to anticipate and shape the future possibilities of the Metaverse beyond current technological and market constraints. By breaking down the Metaverse into targeted applications, this work provides a roadmap for advancing theory, design, and practice to unlock the Metaverse’s full disruptive potential. We challenge the notion that the Metaverse is “dead,” instead framing it as an enduring societal and economic transformation catalyst."
MMIS,2025,Demystifying the Dimensions and Roles of Metaverse Gaming Experience Value: A Multi-Study Investigation,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2452014,"Understanding metaverse gaming experience value (MGEV) is crucial for the success of metaverse games. However, prior research lacks context-specific theoretical knowledge of MGEV dimensions, roles, and practical guidance for enhancing player experience value. To address this gap, we conducted an abductive, multi-study investigation to develop a multi-dimensional typology of MGEV, demonstrate its nomological validity, and propose a player-centered approach for its investigation. First, we performed qualitative manual coding of online reviews to identify six MGEV dimensions. We developed a two-axis typology that categorizes these dimensions by motivation- (intrinsic vs. extrinsic) and activeness-focused (active vs. reactive) perspectives. Second, we developed a deep-learning classification model to automate coding and create a panel dataset. We validated the relationships between MGEV dimensions and players’ word-of-mouth (WOM) by analyzing the panel dataset. Third, we applied a player-centered approach with cluster analysis to the coded data. We uncovered three player groups with distinct MGEV profiles (i.e. intrinsic value-dominated, extrinsic value-dominated, and active value-insensitive), metaverse gaming participation characteristics, and WOM. This paper identifies the context-specific and fine-grained dimensions of MGEV, establishes a valid MGEV framework, and reveals distinct player groups with unique MGEV profiles."
MMIS,2025,Exploring the New Playing Field: The Input-Output Principle of Meta-Sports,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2455774,"Meta-sports, which involve replicating sports in immersive virtual environments, represent a highly developed aspect of the future Metaverse. This study adopts a distributive justice lens to explore how athletes perceive the input-output principle underlying meta-sports platforms and evaluate the fairness of meta-sports competitions. Through a comparative mixed-methods study using nested data from the German Virtual Cycling Bundesliga at two time points, we find that individuals have dynamic information needs when forming transparency perceptions. These perceptions influence how they evaluate the distributive justice of meta-sports. Furthermore, our results suggest that justice perceptions influence an individual’s intention to continue participating, fully mediated by the perceived relevance of the competition. These findings enhance our understanding of Metaverse adoption and emphasize the importance of transparency when replicating physical-world competitions in virtual environments. Based on these results, we propose high-level design principles for future meta-sports platforms and other Metaverse applications relying on similar input-output principles."
MMIS,2025,Modeling and Interpreting the Propagation Influence of Neighbor Information in Time-Variant Networks with Exemplification by Financial Risk Prediction,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2452016,"Extracting effective features from dynamic networks underpins the development of network-based artificial intelligence (AI) methods and decision support systems. Despite existing methods for constructing network features, a notable gap exists in addressing the propagation influence of direct and indirect neighbors. Given the sparse and interacting nature of neighbor information as well as the requirements of interpretability, modeling neighbor influence presents an essential yet challenging research problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Time-vAriant Graph Contrastive Learning method (TAGOL). TAGOL seeks to improve both the effectiveness and interpretability of constructing features related to the propagation influence by explicitly modeling sparse and interacting neighbor information in time-variant networks. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method through two case studies: credit risk prediction and financial distress prediction. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of TAGOL and shed light on the varied influences of the joint propagation of interacting neighbor information on financial risk prediction. The proposed TAGOL and experimental findings offer generalizable methodological and theoretical insights, which can contribute to a broader spectrum of network-related research endeavors, such as short video recommendation systems and transit flow prediction."
MMIS,2025,Value Drivers for Metaverse Business Models: A Complementor Perspective,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2452679,"The Metaverse has emerged as a prominent topic of discussion within the technology industry, presenting a wide array of opportunities for value creation across various businesses. Nevertheless, its value potential remains uncertain due to its early development stage. Our research analyzes 29 cases to address this gap and identify key value drivers for business models of complementors in Metaverse ecosystems. We identified five primary Metaverse-enabled value drivers for complementors (immersive customer engagement, massively scaled user innovation, virtual business efficiency, digital exclusivity, and extended ecosystem collaboration.). We illustrate how these drivers enhance those of ebusiness models, exploring their broader implications for business model innovation and value creation. Our findings provide valuable insights into value-creation opportunities that companies can leverage in the Metaverse, contributing to a better understanding of fundamental value drivers and enabling businesses to navigate this emerging landscape more effectively."
MMIS,2025,How the Metaverse is Reshaping Multichannel Retail Through Balancing Complementarity and Substitution,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2452019,"Although the metaverse can offer a fusion of physical and virtual shopping experiences, there is no consensus on how multichannel retailers can capitalize on this trend by adopting extended reality (XR) online portals. Therefore, we seek to investigate the dynamic influence of XR adoption on offline store performance from the perspective of multichannel retailers. The current study also considers the boundary conditions of the XR type and offline store density. We examined 667 multichannel retailers, with data sources combining online and offline information from 2019 to 2022, resulting in 11,643 monthly retailer-level observations. Applying staggered difference-in-differences models reveals that XR adoption dynamically affects offline store transactions. Furthermore, the effects of XR vary across XR type and offline store density. We aim to provide management implications for multichannel retailers wishing to optimize their channel structures by adopting XR while jumping into the metaverse."
MMIS,2025,Working from the Metaverse: A Distraction Management Perspective,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2452018,"The innovative potential of the Metaverse for knowledge work has mostly been explored in terms of its ability to enhance remote collaboration. However, this paper takes a distraction management perspective and presents findings from a qualitative study where knowledge workers performed solo tasks using an immersive Metaverse application. We posit that knowledge workers can proactively shield themselves from common distractions in collaborative, private, or public spaces by clearly separating their virtual workplace from their physical environment. However, Metaverse applications may also introduce new sources of distraction, requiring knowledge workers to be aware of and able to customize technology affordances to optimize work outcomes. These findings inform a theoretical model ofvirtual workplace distraction management, emphasizing that we should harness its potential to augment, transform, or replace conventional work environments rather than recreating traditional corporate offices in the Metaverse and their common distractions."
MMIS,2025,Foundations of Decentralized Metaverse Economies: Converging Physical and Virtual Realities,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2452017,"Decentralized metaverse economies leverage blockchain cryptocurrency and asset tokens to enhance the concepts of digital ownership and scarcity, uniquely combining aspects of real, virtual, and blockchain economies. This study applies and extends token adoption and valuation theory to conceptualize and empirically analyze the dynamics in decentralized metaverse economies. We analyze over 4.5 million blockchain transactions from two blockchains across two years in the “The Sandbox” metaverse using vector autoregressive models. Our findings reveal complex dynamics among exchange rates, economic actors, and their activity, highlighting the exchange rate’s central role in fostering growth, particularly regarding creating scarce digital assets. The results provide insights for designing and regulating decentralized metaverse economies and offer a novel conceptual framework for understanding these emerging information systems. Our research contributes to the literature by bridging economic theories with the technological realities of blockchain-based metaverses, providing a foundation for future studies on the convergence of real and virtual economies in the metaverse."
MMIS,2025,Omnichannel in Healthcare? Offline-to-Online Spillover Effects and Implications for Telemedicine in Treating Chronic Patients,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2452012,"Despite an annual healthcare expenditure of over $4.1 trillion dollars on chronic patients in the United States alone, chronic diseases remain the leading causes of death and rising healthcare costs. With the potential benefits of online telemedicine consultation, we ask what value omnichannel integration—business approaches that use various channels synergistically to maximize customer value—might provide to healthcare for individual patients with chronic diseases. While new patients may have a lack of experience with telemedicine consultation, existing patients are familiar with the service on telemedicine platforms. How would this difference between new and existing patients affect their preferences for physicians’ channel strategies differently? Through a multi-method empirical approach including a preliminary survey study, econometric analyses of a 51 months’ panel dataset from a prominent healthcare platform in China, rigorous testing using various alternative measures and econometric specifications, and a descriptive analysis of two distinct patient journeys through channels, we consistently observed a strong and positive effect of physicians’ adoption of omnichannel integration on the selection of such physicians for paid online consultations by the platform’s new patients. Meanwhile, this effect among the existing patients of the telemedicine platform is much weaker. These findings are helpful for all healthcare stakeholders, including patients, physicians, hospitals, healthcare platforms, and policymakers."
MMIS,2025,Everyday Metaverse: The Metaverse as an Integral Part of Everyday Life,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2455772,"This paper explores a paradigm shift from viewingthe Metaverse as a distinct digital worldto viewingthe Metaverse as an integral part of everyday life, termed the “Everyday Metaverse.” Previous research on the traditional paradigm falls short of capturing the essence of the emerging paradigm, limiting both scholarly understanding and practical engagement. Through an interpretive case study method, this research investigates the design process of a hybrid city project that strived to integrate Metaverse technologies into the daily lives of its inhabitants. The research identifies vital processual mechanisms in designing the Everyday Metaverse, which involves expanding the digital world to encompass possible physical entities and events and establishing its relevance to life. The findings contribute a new theoretical framework for future research and practice to understand the Everyday Metaverse better."
ISR,2025,"Fashionable Consumer Technology, IT Fashion, and Consumer Behavior",https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2020.0084,"Traditionally thought of as “uncomfortable bedfellows,” consumer IT and fashion are becoming increasingly intertwined, which has given rise to a unique phenomenon termed “consumer IT fashion”—the collective enthusiasm in society for consumer technology. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain how IT fashion is perceived by individual consumers and subsequently influences consumer behavior. Our research aims to bridge this gap. By differentiating between societal-level and individual-level perceptions of IT fashion, the paper introduces novel constructs associated with IT fashion and fashionable consumer technology, particularly perceived societal-level IT fashion (PSITF, reflecting a person’s perception of society’s views on a technology) and perceived fashionableness of IT (PFIT, capturing a person’s perception of the technology’s fashionableness). Moreover, we identify drivers underlying PSITF and PFIT: collective adoption and social endorsement are the drivers of PSITF, whereas the novelty of IT and IT-identity congruity are the drivers of PFIT. A research model is developed to illustrate how IT fashion influences consumer behaviors, such as adoption and purchasing decisions. We conducted two empirical studies to assess our research model. In Study 1, we focused on consumers’ adoption decision of fashionable technology. The findings validate our conceptualization of IT fashion-related constructs and suggest that consumers are inclined to adopt fashionable IT when they believe it enhances their sense of belonging to a group (i.e., external symbolic value) and allows for self-expression (i.e., internal symbolic value). In Study 2, we explored consumers’ purchasing behavior, focusing on their willingness to pay (WTP) for a fashionable technology compared with the alternative IT product with identical functionalities. The results indicate that whereas consumers do acknowledge the symbolic values associated with using fashionable IT, these values do not necessarily translate into a greater WTP. Our research opens novel theoretical avenues for the exploration of IT fashion and lays the groundwork for future investigations in this domain."
ISR,2025,Probing Digital Footprints and Reaching for Inherent Preferences: A Cause-Disentanglement Approach to Personalized Recommendations,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0181,"The abundance of multiple types of consumer digital footprints recorded on e-commerce platforms has fueled the design of personalized recommender systems for decision support. However, capturing consumers’ inherent preferences for effective recommendations based on consumer digital footprints can be challenging because of the multitude of factors driving consumer behaviors. Model training and recommendation outcomes may become biased if other factors are inappropriately recognized as consumers’ inherent preferences in the learning process. Drawing on consumer behavior theories, we tease out various factors that drive consumers’ digital footprints at different consumption stages. We develop a novel recommendation approach, namely, DISC (Disentangling consumers’ Inherent preferences, item Salience effect, and Conformity effect), which leverages disentangled representation learning with a causal graph to derive the effect of each factor driving consumer behaviors. This approach provides personalized and interpretable recommendations based on the inference of consumers’ normative inherent preferences. The DISC model’s identifiability is demonstrated through theoretical analysis, enabling rigorous causal inference based on observational data. To evaluate DISC’s performance, extensive experiments are conducted on real-world data sets with a carefully designed protocol. The results reveal that DISC outperforms state-of-the-art baselines significantly and possesses good interpretability. Moreover, we illustrate the potential impact of different marketing strategies’ by intervening on the disentangled causes through follow-up counterfactual analyses based on the causal graph. Our study contributes to the literature and practice by causally unpacking the behavioral mechanism behind consumers’ digital footprints and designing an interpretable personalized recommendation approach anchored in their inherent preferences."
ISR,2025,Win by Hook or Crook? Self-Injecting Favorable Online Reviews to Fight Adjacent Rivals,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0179,"The existing literature has long assumed that unethical behaviors are fueled by competition. Under this premise, rivalry and competition are often treated interchangeably. This study seeks to challenge this prevailing notion by introducing a conceptual distinction between rivalry and competition. Specifically, we explore the multifaceted relationship between rivalry and unethical behaviors in the context of online review self-injecting behaviors. Drawing on the collective regulatory focus framework and deterrence theory, we posit that rivalry-induced deterrence triggers a shift in mindset from promotion focus to prevention focus, which leads to the formation of mutual forbearance in self-injecting behaviors. Mutual forbearance collapses when one party unilaterally engages in self-injection, prompting the other party to retaliate by increasing their self-injecting activities. Additionally, we propose that firm reputation plays a crucial role in reinforcing the formation of mutual forbearance while mitigating its collapse. Employing an exhaustive data set from Ctrip.com and Qunar.com that comprises 85,939 observations from 3,996 hotels and spans 2018–2020, we found that the presence of an additional rival leads to a 3.2% decrease in self-injecting intensity. Furthermore, self-injecting intensity increases by 0.095% for every 1% rise in that of the rivals and increases by 0.041% for a 1% rise in that of the nonrival competitors. Crucially, our study identifies that firm reputation acts as a significant factor that strengthens the negative relationship between the number of rivals and self-injecting intensity and weakens the positive relationship between a hotel’s self-injecting and its rival’s self-injecting intensity. These empirical findings are supported by a myriad of robust examinations, including the use of a set of subsample analyses, alternative measures of independent variables, alternative instrumental variables, alternative observation time windows, and multiple endogeneity tests. This study contributes to the literature by highlighting the pervasive and potent role of rivalry as an understudied inhibitor of self-injecting behaviors. Our empirical evidence offers critical managerial implications for platforms, sellers, and consumers."
ISR,2025,"Skill-Biased Technical Change, Again? Online Gig Platforms and Local Employment",https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0307,"Online gig platforms have the potential to influence employment in existing industries. Popular press and academic research offer two competing predictions: First, online gig platforms may reduce the supply of incumbent workers by intensifying competition and obsoleting certain skills of workers; or, second, they may boost the supply of workers by increasing client-worker matching efficiency and creating new employment opportunities for workers. Yet, there has been limited understanding of the labor movements amid the rise of online gig platforms. Extending the skill-biased technical change literature, we study the impact of TaskRabbit—alocation-basedgig platform that matches freelance workers to local demand for domestic tasks (e.g., cleaning services)—on the local supply of incumbent, work-for-wages housekeeping workers. We also examine the heterogeneous effects across workers at different skill levels. Exploiting the staggered TaskRabbit expansion into U.S. cities, we identify a significant decrease in the number of incumbent housekeeping workers after TaskRabbit entry. Notably, this is mainly driven by a disproportionate decline in the number of middle-skilled workers (i.e., first-line managers, supervisors) whose tasks could easily be automated by TaskRabbit’s matching algorithms, but not low-skilled workers (i.e., janitors, cleaners) who typically perform manual tasks. Interestingly, TaskRabbit entry doesnotnecessarily crowd out middle-skilled housekeeping workers, neither laying them off nor forcing them to other related occupations; rather, TaskRabbit entry supports self-employment within the housekeeping industry. These findings imply that online gig platforms may not naively be viewed as skill biased, especially for low-skilled workers; instead, theyredistributemiddle-skilled managerial workers whose cognitive tasks are automated by the sorting and matching algorithms to explore new self-employment opportunities for workers, stressing the need to reconsider online gig platforms as a means to reshape existing industries and stimulate entrepreneurial endeavors."
ISR,2025,An Experimental Evaluation of Gender Differences in Responses to Major-Donor Funding Schemes for Crowdfunded Social Ventures,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0318,"Social ventures fundraising through crowdfunding compete for contributions. Thus, they often involve major donors to influence the contributions of smaller donors. We examine what type of major-donor contribution scheme is most likely to attract smaller donors, considering whether and to what degree male and female donors differ in their response to alternative major-donor contribution schemes that are commonly used in practice. In a field experiment, donors were randomly assigned to receive one of three solicitation messages about projects seeking funds through crowdfunding. All donors received identical messages, with the exception that information on major-donor involvement was varied across conditions. The message to the control group made no mention of a major donor. The seed group was informed that a major donor had unconditionally funded the first 50% of the projects’ costs and that the projects were collecting the remaining 50% from other donors; we hypothesize that this scheme is likely to appeal to female donors, who tend to be more uncertainty and risk averse. Finally, the challenge-match group was informed that a major donor would provide the remaining 50% of the projects’ costs after the projects secure the first 50% from other donors; we hypothesize that this scheme is likely to appeal to male donors, who tend to respond more positively to challenges. The major donor in the field experiment—Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft—is an Austrian government agency that promotes and funds innovation. We find that females in the seed group are ∼50% and ∼35% more likely to exhibit an interest in contributing as compared with females in the control or challenge-match conditions, respectively. Among males, we do not observe significant differences in interest in contributing across the three groups. Survey results indicate that females are more responsive to the seed scheme because it yields a perception that the organization conducting the project is of high quality, is likely to reach its funding goal, and is likely to achieve its implementation goals. Our study suggests that social ventures will be more successful at attracting contributions from female donors if a major donor kicks off the campaign with an initial, unconditional contribution."
ISR,2025,Untangling the Performance Impact of E-marketplace Sellers’ Deployment of Platform-Based Functions: A Configurational Perspective,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2020.0539,"Previous studies have shown great interest in examining the performance impact of platform-based functions (PBFs) used by e-marketplace sellers and the contingent role of salient variables, such as seller reputation, in the e-marketplace. Their findings, however, are fragmented and inconsistent, as they generally focus on the net, separate effect of a single PBF with debatable findings. The theorization of how sellers should configure multiple types of PBFs as a whole to achieve high sales performance lags far behind the booming competition practice. To identify an effective PBF combination, this study takes a configurational perspective to identify appropriate PBF configurations that can achieve high sales performance for sellers with different product positions and reputations. A fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis of a longitudinal data set of over 3,300 apparel sellers in a large e-marketplace yields interesting findings. The configuration results reveal recipes for PBF combinations for achieving high sales performance that vary across different levels of seller reputation and product positioning strategies. Our configuration findings suggest that sellers should configure PBFs according to distinctive product strategies accompanied by seller reputation conditions, where the resulting PBF configurations play an essential and multifaceted role in achieving high sales performances. Interestingly, our configuration analysis uncovers that for reputable sellers offering high-priced products, the utilization of pricing and marketing functions is counterproductive. Additionally, we observe complex interplays between after-sales functions and online reputation, characterized by complementary, substitutive, and independent relationships. Furthermore, our results demonstrate an asymmetry relationship between high and low sales configurations. It contributes to the emergent investigation of causal complexity in competitive strategy studies of e-marketplace sellers and provides specific causal recipes and holistic guidelines for sellers and platform operators."
ISR,2025,Return of the Movie Night? Analyzing the Impact of Netflix Subscriptions on Offline Movie Spending,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0530,"The subscription-based business model is disruptive in the copyright industries. More than a digitalized distribution channel, it fundamentally transforms both supply and demand sides by offering new forms of content creation, provision, and consumption. However, the effects of these business models on the local offline industry are less well understood, especially in the case of the motion picture industry. This study investigates the impact of the subscription-based business model on offline activity consumption in the motion picture industry. Leveraging a unique data set with individuals’ every transaction record and a difference-in-differences approach, we show that Netflix subscription interestingly increases offline movie consumption. Based on the argument that individuals have unmet social and hedonic demands that are imperfectly met by subscription-based services, like Netflix, we show that offline movie consumption actually increases postsubscription, accompanied by social and hedonic activities, like dining and entertainment spending. We also provide evidence that the identified positive effect on offline movie consumption is more pronounced for individuals with higher social and hedonic needs (i.e., lower-income people and younger people). Our work provides clear implications for managers and policymakers who are involved in both subscription-based platforms, like Netflix, and the traditional offline movie industry. In addition, we provide theoretical implications for the study of subscription-based platforms, the imperfect substitution of channels, and the role of social and hedonic value in technology-supported platforms."
ISR,2025,To Partner or Not to Partner? The Partnership Between Platforms and Data Brokers in Two-Sided Markets,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0470,"Data have become an important competitive asset, especially for online advertising platforms, leading to the emergence of a new data broker industry. Platforms can partner with data brokers to acquire external data to enhance their targeting capabilities, but this practice has stoked growing consumer privacy concerns. This study develops a game-theoretic model to examine the economic mechanism underlying the partnership between competing platforms and a data broker in a two-sided market. Interestingly, our analysis shows that increasing consumer privacy concerns caused by the data broker may encourage platforms to partner with the data broker rather than discourage them. The driving force is that, because of negative cross-side network effects from advertisers to consumers, increased privacy concerns can serve as a strategic lever to soften price competition on the advertiser side. However, when both platforms partner with the data broker, a prisoner’s dilemma may arise in equilibrium even when the data broker can greatly improve the targeting capabilities. We find that the platform-data broker partnership hurts consumer surplus when platforms adopt a pure ad-sponsored model without charging consumers, but it may benefit consumer surplus when platforms adopt a mixed model with ad-sponsored and subscription-based revenue. Moreover, our analysis indicates that platforms may not have incentives to adopt high levels of privacy protection and may instead adopt asymmetric privacy protection strategies, with one platform adopting high privacy protection and the other opting for low protection. A series of model extensions confirm the robustness of our key findings. We conclude with a discussion of managerial and policy implications."
ISR,2025,Player-vs.-Player Game Design and Pricing: A Tournament Design Perspective,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0258,"Player-versus-player (PvP) games often allow users to purchase superior virtual gears to increase their winning odds in battles against others. This game design, known as “pay to win,” generates substantial revenues from paying players, but it may also adversely affect the gaming experience of nonpaying players and lead to a decline in the game’s popularity. Game developers thus need to strike a balance between revenue and player participation. This paper develops a model to analyze optimal versioning and pricing strategies for PvP games. Building on the classic product line design framework with network effects, we allow a monopolistic game developer to strategically manipulate gameplay (dis-)advantages across different versions, which we refer to as tournament design, and this generates version-specific network effects. We characterize the developer’s optimal strategy and obtain the following insights. First, tournament design improves the developer’s flexibility in pricing and versioning, and it effectively mitigates the extent of product cannibalization. Second, tournament design enables the developer to monetize free players’ participation by offering multiple free versions, and a “freemium” strategy (i.e., the combination of a free-to-play model and a pay-to-win system) can arise in the optimum. Third, tournament design is particularly effective in increasing the developer’s profit when players are willing to play the game but are reluctant to pay. Fourth, tournament design leads to a Pareto improvement for both the developer and all players. The practical implications of these findings are also discussed."
ISR,2025,An Explainable Artificial Intelligence Approach Using Graph Learning to Predict Intensive Care Unit Length of Stay,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0029,"Intensive care units (ICUs) are critical for treating severe health conditions but represent significant hospital expenditures. Accurate prediction of ICU length of stay (LoS) can enhance hospital resource management, reduce readmissions, and improve patient care. In recent years, widespread adoption of electronic health records and advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have facilitated accurate predictions of ICU LoS. However, there is a notable gap in the literature on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods that identify interactions between model input features to predict patient health outcomes. This gap is especially noteworthy as the medical literature suggests that complex interactions between clinical features are likely to significantly impact patient health outcomes. We propose a novel graph learning-based approach that offers state-of-the-art prediction and greater interpretability for ICU LoS prediction. Specifically, our graph-based XAI model can generate interaction-based explanations supported by evidence-based medicine, which provide rich patient-level insights compared with existing XAI methods. We test the statistical significance of our XAI approach using a distance-based separation index and utilize perturbation analyses to examine the sensitivity of our model explanations to changes in input features. Finally, we validate the explanations of our graph learning model using the conceptual evaluation property (Co-12) framework and a small-scale user study of ICU clinicians. Our approach offers interpretable predictions of ICU LoS grounded in design science research, which can facilitate greater integration of AI-enabled decision support systems in clinical workflows, thereby enabling clinicians to derive greater value."
ISR,2025,Should Ad Exchanges Subsidize Advertisers to Acquire Targeting Data?,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0126,"Large volumes of online impressions are sold daily via real-time auctions to deliver targeted advertisements to consumers. Advertisers use data to learn about user preferences and select the most appropriate ad for each user, which also helps them optimize their bids in an ad auction. Although ad exchanges may provide some user data to advertisers, they are usually limited, and advertisers often acquire data from various sources to improve targeting performance. The acquisition of such data can significantly influence the revenue of the ad exchange, which motivates ad exchanges to take actions that reduce advertisers’ data acquisition costs and encourage them to buy data. Previous studies have examined the impact of ad exchanges revealing their data to advertisers, but little attention has been paid to the impact of ad exchanges subsidizing advertisers to acquire data from third parties. To address this gap, we propose three subsidy frameworks to increase ad exchange revenue by inducing more advertisers to acquire data: all subsidized (AS), winner subsidized (WS), and loser subsidized. Using a stylized model, we analyze the impact of subsidy provisions on the platform’s net revenue. Our results show that WS can be better or worse than AS depending on the cost of data acquisition, its beneficial impact on ad selection, and the distribution of impression values."
ISR,2025,Identity Work in Interdependent Professional Groups: The Role of a Target Identity in Enterprise Systems Implementation,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0534,"Enterprise systems (ESs) can be important for the development and maintenance of professional role identities. Prior work shows that a new ES implementation can trigger significant identity work in individuals and groups if it alters their tasks or responsibilities. What has received less attention is that the introduction of a new ES may affect multiple, interdependent professional groups simultaneously, changing how these professional groups can or must interact based on the system properties. Consequently, the introduction of a new ES may also affect how these groups maintain distinctive professional role identities. This study examines how the introduction of a new ES affects the identity work of interdependent professional groups in an organization. Drawing on a revelatory context, we studied the identity work of management accountants and financial accountants in six cases where a new ES merged traditionally separate financial and management accounting modules into one general accounting module. To understand the emergent identity work, we present the construct of a target identity (i.e., a tentative enhanced professional role identity that professional groups actively strive to achieve) and describe three patterns of identity work. We derive five propositions about the conditions under which interdependent professional groups develop a target identity, about the consequences of (not) achieving a target identity, and about the willingness of interdependent professional groups to renegotiate their role boundaries."
ISR,2025,Resale Royalty in Non-Fungible Token Marketplaces: Blessing or Burden for Creators and Platforms?,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0035,"Non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces enable users to mint and trade digital assets, such as collectibles, trading cards, and digital artwork. Many of these platforms accommodate resale royalties, which return a predetermined percentage of the proceeds from future resales of the digital asset to the creator. Although the adoption of resale royalties may seem beneficial for NFT creators by providing a recurring source of income, it could have unintended consequences on the sales price and the liquidity of the underlying NFT, potentially affecting both the platform’s commission revenue and the creator’s short-term return. In this paper, we aim to understand the antecedents and consequences of resale royalties. Specifically, we empirically investigate the impact of minting costs on royalty rates and subsequently, the effects of resale royalties on primary market sales prices and liquidity. Our identification strategy combines a difference-in-differences model that leverages a policy change that eliminated up-front minting fees for creators and an instrumental variables approach. We find that NFT creators reduce royalty rates when they mint an NFT without incurring minting costs. Furthermore, we observe that higher royalty rates lead to reduced sales prices in the primary market, suggesting the presence of adelayed gratification effectas creators hope for future royalty payments. We also investigate the underlying mechanisms, and we find that NFT creators who are more confident about future resales tend to lower their primary sale prices but are unable to recoup those losses in the short term, providing evidence of anoverconfidence effect. Surprisingly, we find that the presence of resale royalties also negatively affects market liquidity despite reduced sales prices. Our findings offer immediate implications for creators and platforms regarding resale royalty strategies and whether to enforce royalties."
ISR,2025,And No One Gets the Short End of the Stick: A Blockchain-Based Approach to Solving the Two-Sided Opportunism Problem in Interorganizational Information Sharing,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0065,"The threat of opportunistic behavior is an enduring problem in interorganizational information sharing based on sensitive data. The two sides of opportunism in interorganizational information sharing—information poachingby the information recipient andinformation manipulationby the information provider—may preclude beneficial information sharing relationships altogether. Previously proposed organizational and technical countermeasures against the threat of opportunism either fail to reliably prevent information poaching and manipulation or prevent only one of them at a time. To address these shortcomings, we develop three design principles for an information system that facilitates reliable information sharing based on sensitive data in interorganizational business transactions without revealing the actual data. We instantiate our design principles in a multicompany research consortium for wear-based leasing contracts for machine tools. Through in-depth interview sessions with business and technology experts, we demonstrate the efficacy of our artifact in addressing the two-sided opportunism problem. A survey-based evaluation of the artifact’s utility in the context of machine tool leasing shows that organizations are willing to engage in more interorganizational information sharing, rely more on shared information, and draw on more sensitive data when provided with our solution. The study makes three key contributions. First, it contributes to the literature on interorganizational information sharing by identifying information poaching and information manipulation as two sides of the same problem and by showing empirically that opportunities for beneficial business arise if both forms of opportunism are addressed simultaneously. Second, our design principles constitute a blueprint of a shared information system that enables reliable (i.e., verifiably truthful) information sharing between business partners without revealing the data underlying the shared information. Third, the study contributes to the literature on blockchain systems by recombining specific blockchain technology components, namely, private data collections, smart contracts, and joint governance, in a useful, novel way."
ISR,2025,How Product Display Orientation Affects Customers’ Choice Satisfaction in Online Purchase: A Choice Closure Perspective,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0575,"Online retailers often confront the problem of order cancellation due to customers’ poor satisfaction with their online purchase decision, termed aschoice satisfactionin this study. However, very little e-commerce literature has addressed customer choice satisfaction, and none, to our knowledge, has investigated how to design product display interfaces to achieve it. Drawing from choice closure theory and eye and vision research, we examine how product display orientation of an online shopping web page affects customers’ choice satisfaction upon purchase. We propose that a horizontal (versus vertical) display of comparable products on an e-commerce website is more positively related to customer choice satisfaction by promoting a higher level of choice closure (a psychological process by which online customers come to perceive a decision as completed and settled). Through five carefully designed experiments (including one using an eye-tracking device), we find that online customers achieve a higher level of choice satisfaction from an assortment of comparable products displayed horizontally than vertically on e-commerce websites. This effect results from the fact that a horizontal product display increases the amount of comparisons customers make between product options prior to making a purchase decision and consequential sense of choice closure after the decision. We also find that a cue of finality (e.g., adding a textual note “The end” to the product display) can largely attenuate this effect. The implications for online retailers’ product showcase strategies are discussed, along with future research directions."
ISR,2025,Mergers Between On-Demand Service Platforms: The Impact on Consumer Surplus and Labor Welfare,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0553,"On-demand service platforms connect customers with independent service providers (agents) by competitively setting service prices and wages. Mergers between on-demand service platforms have recently become prevalent, resulting in antitrust debates. A merger, although reducing competition, enables the agents on previously separate platforms to serve all the customers. In this paper, we develop a game-theoretical model to analyze the impact of a merger between two platforms. The two platforms compete on prices and wages before the merger, but are managed by a single firm after the merger. We show that a merger not only creates pooling benefits, but also enhances the cross-side network effect (i.e., customers benefit from more agents and vice versa). As a result, it can lead to a win-win-win outcome, where the platforms’ profits, consumer surplus, and labor welfare all improve after a merger. The win-win-win outcome is more probable if the premerger market is less saturated or if the market is more differentiated on the customer/agent side. Interestingly, a stronger within-side congestion effect may either strengthen or weaken a merger’s potential to benefit customers. Additionally, we show that a merger is less likely to improve consumer surplus and labor welfare if there are more multihoming agents in the market and that it is more likely to benefit labor welfare if there is less cross-side price transparency. Our results provide guidelines for antitrust policymakers to evaluate the impact of a merger between on-demand service platforms."
ISR,2025,Two-Sided Impacts of Service Provider’s Identity Disclosure in e-Customer Service Platforms: Evidence from Two Field Experiments,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0499,"Digital advancements have revolutionized customer service by enabling customers to easily express dissatisfaction and request resolutions through online platforms. Customer complaint management platforms are especially unique in facilitating provider-customer interactions, but researchers overlook implications from service provider anonymity. In this article, two randomized field experiments are conducted to examine a customer complaint management platform to identify how disclosure of service provider identity affects service performance, customer satisfaction, and biases in customers. Study 1, a large-scale randomized field experiment involving 75,041 customers and 1,280 service providers across 672 companies, finds that identity disclosure improves provider performance. This improvement is achieved by removing the provider’s dissociative anonymity, mitigating deindividuation, instilling self-awareness, and motivating personal responsibility. This effect is stronger for inexperienced service providers who work with many colleagues and have more discretion in handling complaints. Customers who receive identity details about providers benefit from better service and perceive higher satisfaction with complaint resolution. Study 2, a field experiment involving 2,710 customers, shows that customers report more satisfaction when customers identify that providers belong to the majority ethnic group compared with when they belong to an ethnic minority. Intriguingly, minority customers showed lower satisfaction with same-ethnicity providers, indicating that ethnic cues and identity matching significantly influence customer satisfaction. Four follow-up studies involving 1,211 participants identify the underlying mechanisms that influence customer and provider behaviors. The article concludes with practical implications for firms and platforms dedicated to customer service."
ISR,2025,Lost Time in Crowdsourcing Contests,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0502,"Crowdsourcing contests have become increasingly popular as a means of seeking innovative solutions to business problems. However, the abundance of concurrent contests on platforms can lead to disparities in solvers’ contest awareness, resulting in “lost time”—the time elapsed between the start of a contest and a solver’s first visit. This study investigates how lost time influences solvers’ submission behavior and its subsequent impact on matching inefficacy as measured by solver disqualification, which occurs when a solver fails to produce a submission meeting the seeker’s baseline criteria. Utilizing a proprietary data set from a European crowdsourcing platform, we employ a mediation analysis framework to examine the relationship between lost time and two key dimensions of submission behavior: time to first submission and number of submissions. Our findings reveal that higher levels of lost time are associated with fewer submissions, indicating reduced solver persistence. However, this negative effect is partially mitigated by solvers’ faster initial submissions when facing lost time. Importantly, we demonstrate that changes in submission behavior fully mediate the negative impact of lost time on solver disqualification, highlighting the crucial role of submission behavior in influencing solver disqualification. Furthermore, we provide evidence supporting latecomer disadvantage as an important mechanism driving solvers’ behavioral responses to lost time. Our study contributes to the crowdsourcing literature by uncovering the impact of lost time on solvers’ behavior and performance, offering valuable insights for contest design. By understanding and mitigating the effects of latecomer disadvantage, platforms can enhance the effectiveness of crowdsourcing in solving problems."
ISR,2025,Growing Platforms by Adding Complementors Without a Contract,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0237,"Multisided platforms often pursue growth strategies of expanding participants on one side (e.g., suppliers) and leveraging the cross-side network effect to attract participants on other sides (e.g., consumers). Whereas formal contractual agreements have traditionally been the norm for onboarding suppliers, an emerging trend involves platforms enabling consumers to interact with noncontracted suppliers via third-party enablers with both sharing profits from providing complementary services. This study examines this strategy of increasing market thickness in the context of food delivery platforms, focusing on the platforms’ inclusion of restaurants as “nonpartnered” restaurants. Nonpartnered restaurants do not pay commission fees for being listed on the platforms and do not control their menu or item prices. The platforms collect and transfer consumer orders to the third-party deliverers who place the order, pick it up, and deliver the food to consumers. The strategy has drawn regulatory scrutiny regarding its potential harm to nonpartnered restaurants and consumers. This research empirically investigates the impact of this noncontracted partnership on restaurants, leveraging two natural experiments: (1) a number of nonpartnered restaurants were listed on the platform, and (2) the restaurants were later delisted because of a governmental regulation. Our findings show that being added as a nonpartnered restaurant increases these restaurants’ revenue from takeout orders by about $1,410 per month. Adding nonpartnered restaurants also has a positive spillover effect on the revenue of partnered restaurants already on the platform. Finally, the delisting of nonpartnered restaurants leads to a drop in their takeout orders as well as a negative spillover on the revenue of partnered restaurants. In essence, a nonpartnered contract benefits most restaurants, especially independent restaurants. These insights can inform the design of platform and regulatory policies related to noncontracted growth strategies."
ISR,2025,An Investigation ofp-Hacking in E-Commerce A/B Testing,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2024.0872,"In recent years, randomized experiments (or “A/B tests”) have become commonplace in many industrial settings as managers increasingly seek the aid of scientific rigor in their decision making. However, just as this practice has proliferated among firms, the problem ofp-hacking—whereby experimenters adjust their sample size or try several statistical analyses until they find one that produces a statistically significantp-value—has emerged as a prevalent concern in the scientific community. Notably, many commentators have highlighted how A/B testing software enables and may even encouragep-hacking behavior. To investigate this phenomenon, we analyze the prevalence ofp-hacking in a primary sample of 2,270 experiments conducted by 242 firms on a large U.S.-based e-commerce A/B testing platform. Using multiple statistical techniques—including a novel approach we call theasymmetric caliper test—we analyze thep-values corresponding to each experiment’s designated target metric across multiple significance thresholds. Our findings reveal essentially no evidence forp-hacking in our data. In an extended sample that examinesp-hacking across all outcome metrics (encompassing more than 16,000p-values in total), we similarly observe no evidence ofp-hacking behavior. We use simulations to determine that if a modest effect ofp-hacking were present in our data set, our methods would have the power to detect it at our current sample size. We contrast our results with the prevalence ofp-hacking in academic contexts and discuss a number of possible factors explaining the divergent results, highlighting the potential roles of organizational learning and economic incentives."
ISR,2025,Walrasian Pricing for Combinatorial Markets with Compact-Bidding Languages: An Application to Truckload Transportation,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0676,"Combinatorial auctions offer several economic advantages but also face multiple technical challenges, including bid generation, the need to solve a combinatorial allocation problem, and determining reasonable prices. These challenges are even more pronounced in a combinatorial exchange, where bidders can simultaneously buy and sell combinations of goods. Motivated by truckload transportation markets, we explore new mechanisms for finding linear and anonymous Walrasian equilibrium prices in combinatorial auctions and exchanges where bidders can use a compact-bidding language to express their potentially complex preferences. With the goal of improving economic efficiency and reducing the environmental impact of the trucking industry, we identify significant potential gains by developing a method for integrated allocation and price determination based on an industry-specific bidding language. We also demonstrate our proposed mechanism’s adaptability and flexibility by considering a number of practical constraints."
ISR,2025,Team Makes You Better: Evidence from Online Medical Consultation Platforms,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0689,"Virtual teamwork has become a prevalent mode of collaboration. However, scant empirical attention has been given to the impact of virtual teamwork on individual members’ performance beyond the team setting. In this paper, we fill this gap by studying virtual teams in the context of online medical consultation (OMC) platforms. Specifically, we collect data from two OMC platforms during a time period when both platforms offered individual consultations (i.e., one patient connected with one physician) but only one offered team consultations (i.e., one patient connected with a team of physicians). Using a difference-in-difference-in-differences approach, we find that team participation has a robust, positive effect on physicians’ performance in individual consultations. We further explore the potential mechanisms through which team participation improves physicians’ performance. The empirical results indicate that the observed performance improvement is likely driven by peer effects in team settings. In particular, we find that physicians exert more effort in individual consultations after joining a team and that performance improvement is stronger when (1) a physician can easily observe the performance of the physician’s teammates (peers), (2) a physician has teammates (peers) who perform well in individual consultations, (3) a physician has teammates (peers) from the same hospital or the same city, or (4) a physician has a lower performance prior to joining in a team. Our findings shed new light on the boundary-spanning roles of virtual teams and provide timely insights into the ongoing development of OMC platforms."
ISR,2025,A Natural Disaster Reshapes Prosocial Microlending,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0723,"Previous studies have investigated how various factors influence prosocial microlending decisions under normal circumstances. Nevertheless, a natural disaster may result in a situation where lenders can hardly find appropriate loans from the disaster-affected region. When faced with the mismatch between the supply and demand of microloans, lenders can either simply choose not to make any contributions or divert their prosocial intentions toward a different group of beneficiaries. Drawing on the motivated information processing theory, we show that the outcome-focused nature of prosocial motivation drives lenders to seek alternative loans until they achieve the goal of helping others, and the other-focused psychological process prompts lenders to take the victims’ perspectives when deciding which loans to fund. Moreover, lenders’ attention paid to the surrounding regions is distributed in a gradient fashion associated with their geographical distance to the disaster. Using a natural experiment based on the Ebola outbreak in Africa in 2014, our research shows that a natural disaster increases (over the short-term) the average contribution size and decreases (over the long-term) the average fundraising time per dollar for prosocial microloans by borrowers from regions closer to the affected region. In contrast, a natural disaster decreases (over the long-term) the average contribution size and increases (over the long-term) the average fundraising time per dollar for prosocial microloans by borrowers from regions farther away from the affected region. This redistribution of prosocial microlending is an unintended consequence of a natural disaster that inflicts long-term economic hardship in some regions. Policymakers and researchers should closely monitor the redistribution of prosocial microlending resulting from a natural disaster so that prompt action can be taken to alleviate potential negative consequences that may arise."
ISR,2025,Do Reductions in Search Costs for Partial Information on Online Platforms Lead to Better Consumer Decisions? Evidence of Cognitive Miser Behavior from a Natural Experiment,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0432,"Many online platforms have utilized information technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI), to reduce consumers’ information search costs and facilitate their decision-making processes. Given the variety of online information, these technologies are often effective in reducing the search cost for only specific information types: a concept we refer to as search cost reduction for partial information. For rational consumers, this can lead to improved decision making. However, consumers do not always behave rationally and may exhibit behavioral biases in their decision-making process. In this study, we propose that search cost reduction for partial information can induce cognitive miser behavior in consumers, ultimately leading to worse decision-making. To explore this understudied puzzle, we leverage a natural experiment on Yelp to examine the effect of enabling search cost reduction for partial information on the quality of consumers’ decisions regarding restaurants. We constructed a unique panel data set using matched pairs of restaurants across Yelp and TripAdvisor. By applying a difference-in-differences design, we aim to casually infer how consumer decision quality is affected following the introduction of Yelp’s new AI-powered image categorization feature in August 2015, which was designed to reduce the search cost of review images. We find that adding the AI-powered image categorization feature has a negative effect on consumer decision quality. Delving into the text analysis of consumer complaints using deep learning techniques, we further find that the inferior decision quality of consumers postfeature introduction is primarily due to reduced awareness of restaurants’ service quality—information that is readily available in review texts but not in review images. Our findings suggest that reducing search costs for partial information may hurt consumers as it may incentivize cognitive miser behavior. This occurs as consumers disproportionately pay attention to the product information of which the search cost has been reduced, whereas paying less attention to other relevant product information. We discuss the implications of these findings for online platforms."
ISR,2025,The Death of a Technical Skill,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0709,"We analyze how the decline of a technology affects online labor market dynamics. We evaluate the effects of Steve Jobs’ announcement that Apple would no longer support Adobe Flash—a popular set of tools for creating internet applications. Despite a precipitous decline in Flash demand, there is no evidence of a reduction in Flash wages on this platform because the supply response was rapid, particularly among younger developers with readily available “fallback” skills. The key to this rapid adjustment was that the long-run value of the skills that developers expected to acquire on the job acted as a form of nonwage compensation that suddenly fell in its expected value, motivating many developers to switch to other technologies, even though wages themselves did not fall. Our findings underscore how the rise and fall of technologies influences matching in online markets and help to explain (i) why technological obsolescence leaves fewer, older participants in a skill and (ii) why technologies in decline can be contemporaneously characterized by wages that stay flat or even rise in a market setting. Management and policy implications are discussed."
ISR,2025,Push It Cross the Finish Line—Designing Online Interfaces to Induce Choice Closure at the Postdecision Prepurchase Stage,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2021.0085,"As e-commerce and mobile commerce become prevalent, a notable issue indicating a lack of choice closure is that consumers do not complete their purchases after choosing a product (e.g., shopping cart abandonment). Choice closure refers to the psychological process by which decision makers come to perceive a decision to be complete and settled. To foster choice closure, online interface designs hold promising merits in terms of flexible implementations and practical implications. Drawing upon cognitive dissonance theory and self-justification theory, we examine how interface designs can tackle consumers’ negative cognitions to promote choice closure at the postdecision prepurchase stage, whereas the extant literature focuses mainly on enhancing consumers’ positive cognitions leading to their decision satisfaction. Particularly, we investigate the effects of online interface designs on reducing cognitive dissonance (i.e., a negative cognition as an antecedent of perceived choice closure) and examine the relationships between this construct, perceived choice closure, and decision satisfaction. We conducted a series of controlled experiments in a simulated e-commerce site by designing and presenting interface cues as direct and social decision reinforcements at a postdecision prepurchase stage. Our results attest to (1) the effectiveness of the proposed reinforcement cues for inducing choice closure via reduced cognitive dissonance and (2) the significant role of choice closure for consumers’ satisfaction with their decisions in online settings where product consumption/testing is often unfeasible. Theoretical and practical contributions are elaborated."
