2025,Hate Speech Detection on Online News Platforms: A Deep-Learning Approach Based on Agenda-Setting Theory,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2520173,"Hate speech on online news platforms has emerged as a critical societal challenge, influencing public discourse and impacting industries. However, existing detection methods often fail to capture its contextual nature and are grounded in weak theoretical foundations. To address this gap, we integrate agenda-setting theory with design science paradigms to develop a deep learning model for detecting hate speech on online news platforms. Leveraging bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), our model analyzes the interplay between news headlines, texts, and user comments, capturing both media issue salience and emotional agenda-setting effects. Empirical validation demonstrates that our model outperforms traditional baselines in hate speech detection and topic classification tasks. This contextualized approach enhances prediction accuracy, explainability, and domain adaptability, contributing to improved performance and broader applicability. Our study makes theoretical and methodological contributions to Information Systems research and offers practical insights for implementing ethical, real-time hate speech detection strategies."
2025,Can Correction Messages Reduce the Spread of Fake News on Social Media? The Impact of Information Updates on the Effectiveness of Corrections,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2520174,"Although government agencies and fact-checking organizations issue correction messages to mitigate misinformation dissemination on social media, their efforts have been largely ineffective. Drawing on Information Manipulation Theory (IMT) and information extracted from over 84 million tweets, we examine the impact of correction messages and explore how different information updates affect their effectiveness. Our empirical approach differentiates between subpopulations of correction messages. The results support the existence of two distinct types: correction messages that significantly mitigate the spread of fake news—a 1 percent increase in “effective” messages decreases the spread of fake news by 0.89 percent; and those that amplify the misinformation—a 1 percent increase in “ineffective” messages increases the spread of fake news by 1.37 percent. Despite the higher count of “effective” correction messages, they are less potent than their “ineffective” counterparts. Our study extends the tenets of IMT to correction messages to identify effective platform interventions and highlight the efficacy of information updates in reducing the spread of fake news. Furthermore, it offers significant insights to social media platforms and fact-checking organizations on designing and deploying effective corrections."
2025,Understanding the Drivers and Outcomes of Ideologically Charged Social Media Firestorms: The Sociotechnical and Social Learning Perspectives,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2520170,"Social media firestorms, characterized by the rapid spread of negative electronic word of mouth (eWOM), can ignite widespread criticism of a firm’s brand transgressions, service failures, product-harm crises, or ideological conflicts. This study, grounded in the sociotechnical and social learning perspectives, examines the drivers and outcomes of social learning in ideologically charged firestorms, which represent an emerging form. We investigate the effects of social consensus and message persuasiveness, platform content centricity, and individual–firm relationship closeness on the social learning of negative eWOM behavior and purchase behavior. Two studies, comprising longitudinal quantitative and qualitative surveys, were conducted. The results indicate that message persuasiveness is strongly associated with the social learning of negative eWOM behavior. Negative eWOM behavior subsequently influences post-firestorm purchasing behavior. The moderating effects of platform content centricity and individual–firm relationship closeness are discussed. These findings advance the literature and offer practitioners actionable insights into managing digital crises."
2025,"Boundary Morphing: Causes, Consequences, and Architectural Levers",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2520179,"We study how app competitiveness evolves through intertemporal shifts between proprietary code and platform-sourced functionality. We introduce the novel mechanism ofboundary morphing—apps expanding their boundaries by adding proprietary code or contracting them by increasing platform-sourced functionality—by integrating transaction cost economics (TCE) with platforms theory. Using seven years of data from over 600 AndroidOS apps, we show that platform specificity and market uncertainty drive boundary contraction, while frequent updates counterintuitively catalyze boundary expansion. App modularity—acting as a shift parameter—reshapes this calculus, enabling boundary expansion amid uncertainty and rapid updates. We contribute: (1) boundary morphing as a mechanism to straddle synergy-differentiation tradeoffs, (2) IS-native insights in a TCE scaffold to explain morphing, and (3) modularity’s role in reshaping it. Together, these findings explain how apps morph boundaries as an architectural lever to stay competitive."
2025,Algorithmic Stakeholder Governance on Content Platforms: A Lead Role Perspective,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2520177,"Algorithmic governance is not enough on its own to manage and protect the interests of multiple stakeholders. Therefore, platforms are increasingly seeking to involve stakeholders in their algorithmic governance, synthesizing the domains of algorithmic governance and stakeholder governance. We denote this synthesis asalgorithmic stakeholder governance. In this paper, we examine algorithmic stakeholder governance in the context of content platforms focusing on the algorithmically mediated interactions among three key stakeholders—creators, consumers, and advertisers. We explore this topic by conducting an in-depth study of the YouTube platform. Using grounded theory techniques, we generate a model that explains the process by which platform stakeholder interactions are algorithmically governed to address key stakeholder conflicts related to free speech, information diversity, and content safety. Our model suggests that algorithmic stakeholder governance provides a forum for resolving these stakeholder conflicts and theorizes the interplay between the platform’s approach to algorithmic stakeholder governance and stakeholder participation. Our research contributes primarily to the literature on platform governance and algorithmic governance on platforms more specifically, by shifting the focus from centralized control and viewing users as objects of governance towards a more decentralized and balanced perspective where platform users are viewed as active stakeholders."
2025,Roles of Psychological Recovery Experiences and Visual Anonymity in Team-based Gamified Online Learning,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2520175,"Gamification has been widely adopted by businesses and educational institutions to drive desired user behaviors and performance. Despite its significance across industry, healthcare, and organizational contexts, its role in fostering psychological recovery experiences (PRE) remains underexplored. Grounded in gamification frameworks and literature on affordances and PRE, this study investigates the mediating role of PRE between gamification affordances and personal initiative. Additionally, we examine the moderating effect of perceived visual anonymity as a situational affordance in the relationship between gamification affordances and PRE. To test our hypotheses, we collected data from 682 graduate students enrolled in an enterprise resource planning (ERP) course (Study 1: 258; Study 2: 424). Our findings reveal that mastery and control experiences mediate the relationship between collaboration and feedback affordances and personal initiative. Furthermore, perceived visual anonymity negatively moderates the relationship between collaboration affordance and mastery and control experiences, while positively moderating the relationship between feedback affordance and control experience. This study highlights the importance of psychological recovery experiences and perceived visual anonymity in fostering personal initiative within gamified online learning environments."
2025,Risk of Cyberattacks Arising from Strategic Alliances with Big Tech,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2520176,"This research theorizes and documents for the first time a cyber risk that may arise from strategic alliances with Big Tech, a grouping of the most dominant companies in the information technology industry. This research proposes that alliances with Big Tech tend to involve leveraging and integrating Big Tech’s innovative technological capabilities into a focal firm’s data management, operations, products, or services. This process can be understood as an inter-organizational system of systems integration and is presented as a mechanism that makes focal firms vulnerable to external cyberattacks. In addition, this research theorizes and shows that the effect of strategic alliances with Big Tech on the risk of cyberattacks is not linear; instead, it increases up to a certain point and then starts decreasing. Finally, this research suggests that intangible asset intensity strengthens the relationship between strategic alliances with Big Tech and the risk of cyberattacks. The findings of this research provide timely and important insights into cyber risks arising from strategic alliances centered on integrating systems and technologies across partner firms’ boundaries."
2025,Mixed Signals: The Effects of Online Rating Discrepancy on User Trust,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2520178,"This study investigates how discrepancies in reputational signals across online platforms affect users’ trust and cognitive processes. Using an eye-tracking experiment, it examines participants’ responses to conflicting ratings, with a focus on attention patterns and decision-making. Results reveal that signal discrepancies significantly reduce trust. Participants exhibit increased cognitive load when confronted with inconsistent signals, as evidenced by longer fixation times and more frequent transitions between ratings. These findings suggest that conflicting information demands greater cognitive effort. The study also highlights the differential effects of primary (native) and secondary (imported) signals, demonstrating that platform-specific reputational systems play a dominant role in trust-building. By offering insights into the relationship among conflicting signals, trust, and cognitive processing, the study provides a novel theoretical perspective on reputation portability and derives practical implications for complementors and platform operators."
2025,Digital Skill Visibility and Job Promotion of Open Source Software Developers,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2520171,"Material to inform the decisions on the job promotion of open source software (OSS) developers is available on platforms. Digital features increase the visibility of OSS developer technical and interpersonal skills. Digital features also make it possible for OSS developers to visibly receive endorsements and recommendations from others about those skills. It is unclear how well the visibility of technical versus interpersonal skills through such digital features facilitates OSS developer job promotions. Leveraging Turner’s contest-sponsored mobility framework [66], we theorize and empirically examine these concerns using a sample of 269 OSS developers. We find that a developer making their technical skills visible on digital platforms is associated with job promotions. In contrast, the visibility of interpersonal skills through recommendations affects job promotions. Our findings contribute to theory and practice by providing a lens to understand the differential effects of technical versus interpersonal skill visibility offered by different digital features and their effect on OSS developer job promotions."
2025,Impact of Non-Diagnostic Digital Services on Online Healthcare Consultation,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2520180,"The persistent preference of patients for well-known healthcare providers inevitably leads to demand imbalances within the healthcare sector. Luckily, our research reveals that online healthcare platforms (OHPs) can address this issue by offering non-diagnostic digital services. Using an OHP-based online prescribing service as an example, our study reveals that this non-diagnostic digital service has resulted in a significant increase in consultations, particularly for less prominent hospitals and junior physicians. This shift promotes a more equitable distribution of healthcare demand. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the balancing effect primarily arises from attracting low-uncertainty demand–consultations that focus less on diagnosis—and from fostering trust between patients and physicians. Our findings present a compelling information systems (IS) solution to the pressing issue of patient demand imbalance. By illustrating how a non-diagnostic digital solution can transform healthcare delivery and enhance resource allocation, we contribute to improved healthcare efficiency. This paper offers insights for researchers focused on OHP design and for health practitioners seeking to leverage digital solutions to manage demand."

2025,Generative AI and its Transformative Value for Digital Platforms,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2487315,"The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) represents a watershed moment in the evolution of digital platforms. The capabilities of this AI technology go beyond traditional AI systems, enabling the autonomous generation of novel outcomes with significant implications for platform value creation, architecture, governance, and stakeholder interactions. We develop an integrative conceptual framework that identifies four key mechanisms through which GenAI transforms digital platforms: intelligent automation, democratization, hyper-personalization, and collaborative innovation. Through intelligent automation, GenAI transforms boundary resources from passive interfaces into active, intelligent mediators of value creation. Democratization systematically lowers barriers to platform participation. Hyper-personalization enables dynamic, individual-level adaptation of platform content. Collaborative innovation transforms platform innovation by making GenAI an active participant in human-AI value co-creation. We use this framework to situate the papers in the special issue and develop a research agenda that explores the transformative impact of GenAI on platform stakeholder relationships."
2025,Heterogeneous Effects of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) on Knowledge Seeking in Online Communities,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2487313,"Generative AI (GenAI) may fundamentally reshape how users seek knowledge in online knowledge sharing communities. Although prior work found an overall decrease in knowledge seeking in online communities upon the availability of GenAI, the underlying dynamics across user groups have remained unexplored. This study addresses that gap. Drawing on commitment-based theory, we hypothesize that casual users—motivated by cost-benefit considerations—are more likely to reduce their question-posting activity than highly committed members. Using adifference-in-differencesanalysis, we find that ChatGPT’s arrival leads to a substantial drop in questions on StackExchange, primarily driven by casual users (about 18.2%). Motivated by information foraging theory, we reveal heterogeneous downstream effects of GenAI on question characteristics. In particular, we find that the questions by casual users become more complex and novel, while those by intensive and top users do not. These results highlight the importance of heterogeneous user motivations in shaping platform dynamics, underscoring that while GenAI may diminish overall participation, it may also increase the value of the remaining content. Our study offers insights for knowledge sharing communities, managers, and stakeholders reliant on user-generated data, providing a nuanced view of GenAI’s disruptive influence."
2025,Shifting Dynamics: How Generative AI as a Boundary Resource Reshapes Digital Platform Governance,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2487312,"Digital platforms are increasingly integrating Generative AI (GenAI) tools as a boundary resource to enhance the quantity and quality of content with the ultimate goal of improving platform viability. As GenAI tools hold unique characteristics compared to traditional boundary resources, platform owners need to adapt their governance mechanisms accordingly. To understand how platform governance evolves over time in response to this novel boundary resource, we draw on the distributed tuning framework and build on insights from an in-depth qualitative study of a digital content platform in the educational sector. We find that the platform owner deployed different logics of GenAI integration over time that were enacted through specific governance mechanisms. The shift in logics and respective governance mechanisms was triggered by a dialectic process of resistance and accommodation between platform actors. In this process, the GenAI-enabled boundary resource not only changed over time but also served as a means for the power dynamics between platform owner and complementors to be reshaped. Our study contributes to both the platform governance literature as well as recent debates around GenAI."
2025,Are You Willing to Pay for Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) Products? Disentangling the Disclosure Effects and the Mediating Role of Psychological Value,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2487314,"While digital platform vendors are rapidly offering new generative artificial intelligence products (GAIPs), prior research on algorithmic aversion suggests that users may not respond to them the same way as to the human-generated products (HGPs). We propose that GAIPs induce psychological value, defined as a user’s intrinsic desire for a product that can influence their willingness to pay and may depend on the product type. Disclosing a product as a GAIP or HGP could further influence user reactions. From our randomized experiments with three different products representing functional, hybrid, and creative product types, we find psychological value plays an important role in creative products, such as wall art. Human disclosure shows no effect on functional or highly creative products. Our study theoretically extends the algorithmic aversion literature by illustrating the role of psychological value in GAIP highlighting the nuanced role of product type and disclosure in influencing user reactions and offering practical implications."
2025,Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)-Based Recommender Addressing Contribution Pollution and Information Cacophony on Digital Platforms,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2487311,"Digital platforms facilitate interactions among geographically distributed users which reinforce the positive network effects. However, a disproportionate increase in the contributions of users results in contribution pollution (disproportionate increase in users’ contributions) and information cacophony (incoherence of contributions). Unaddressed, contribution pollution and information cacophony challenges have negative implications for platform efficiency and users’ humanistic outcomes. This paper highlights the limitations of existing mechanisms and proposes a framework for a generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)–based recommender system. To evaluate the efficacy of the GenAI–based recommender system, we develop an agent-based simulation model and conduct experiments using real data from three platforms (Reddit, Hacker News, and Stack Overflow). This research contributes a novel sociotechnical framework that addresses the challenges of contribution pollution and information cacophony. For the governance of platforms, this research provides actionable guidance on the policy implications of integrating GenAI-based technologies for user- and platform-level outcomes."
2025,Complementor Value Co-Creation in Generative AI Platform Ecosystems,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2487310,"Compared to traditional digital technologies, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) exhibits two facets—open-endedness and inscrutability—that create challenges for the value co-creation of complementors in GenAI platform ecosystems. For example, complementors lack standardized, reusable functionality that powers their applications and struggle to consistently generate desired outputs. To identify how complementors mitigate these challenges, we conducted an embedded case study of complementors in the OpenAI platform ecosystem. We identified four value co-creation mechanisms of embedded and stand-alone complements that mitigate the challenges: (1) utilizing system instructions, (2) providing context data, (3) curating user inputs, and (4) revising AI model outputs. Depending on the complement type, complementors employ these mechanisms, leverage synergies between mechanisms, and unlock previously not employable mechanisms. We contribute to research by revealing two novel logics—the reap logic and the differentiation logic—that explain how complementors co-create value by mitigating the challenges through the value co-creation mechanisms."
2025,Effects of Nudging and Privacy Control on Online Physician Reviews: Evidence from a Field Experiment,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2487309,"Patients using healthcare services have substantial privacy concerns when writing online reviews of their physicians that may deter them from sharing information potentially helpful for others. This gives rise to a dilemma in which patients have to trade off between privacy and social welfare, leading to fewer and less informative reviews. To examine this trade off, we study how nudging strategies together with privacy control affect reviewers’ decisions related to the provision of reviews, disclosure of sensitive information, and identity revelation. We conducted a large-scale two-stage field experiment, complemented by lab experiments, to establish causality. Results reveal that nudging with an open appeal, compared to nudging with targeted benefits, increases the likelihood of patients submitting reviews. However, nudges that highlight benefits to self increase the proportion of patients revealing sensitive medical information in their reviews and the likelihood of them revealing their identity. Additionally, preemptive privacy control increases the likelihood of identity revelation without adversely impacting the sharing of sensitive information in reviews. Our findings highlight how nudging and privacy control influence patients’ review provision behavior. This study offers strategic implications for online platforms navigating the complex interplay of consumer motivations and privacy concerns in healthcare."
2025,Job Crafting in the Context of Enterprise System Implementations,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2487305,"This paper examines employees’ job crafting in the context of enterprise system (ES) implementations. Job crafting refers to employees’ self-initiated changes aimed at improving their jobs. Drawing on self-construal and trait activation theories, we posit that personality traits associated with an independent self-construal (conscientiousness [CONSC] and openness [OPEN]) and an interdependent self-construal (agreeableness [AGREE] and extraversion [EXTRA]) promote and inhibit job crafting, respectively, with their effects moderated by ES-enabled opportunity (OPPT) and self-efficacy (SE). We further posit that job crafting increases job performance and job satisfaction. We tested our hypotheses with data from a public agency (n = 180) and a Fortune-1000 firm (n = 872). Results showed that personality traits, OPPT, and SE interacted to affect job crafting, which in turn increased job performance and job satisfaction. Our research underscores job crafting as a potent means for employees to effectively navigate ES implementations and sheds light on individual differences in job crafting motivation and behavior."
2025,Understanding the Role of Technology in Coordination Through Affordance Configurations,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2487306,"Coordination of work activities through information exchange is fundamental and increasingly occurs over technology, yet breakdowns are frequent and lead to performance declines. Taking an episodic lens and applying configurational theorizing, we identify seven technology-enabled coordination affordances that facilitate enactment of coordination episodes. Given that coordination episodes often involve combinations of these affordances, we use qualitative comparative analysis (a technique used for configurational analysis) to identify affordance configurations associated with successful coordination. By analyzing our data and paying special attention to coordination breakdowns, we uncover how each configuration is suited to manage a specific type of coordination dependency (pooled, sequential, or kairotic). We contribute to the affordances literature by recognizing the relationship between first-order affordances, which are enabled by technology features, and affordance configurations (analogous to higher-level affordances). We contribute to coordination theory by providing new insights into how technology can augment human coordination and describe a new type of dependency (kairotic). Our work helps inform the design of systems to support coordination processes."
2025,The Algorithm Discount: Explaining Consumers’ Valuation of Human- versus Algorithm-Created Digital Products,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2487308,"Owing to advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI), machines can now create digital products like software applications or media content, evoking calls to label such products as “AI-made.” Research on the handmade effect and algorithm aversion suggests that consumers react negatively to digital products that have been created by generative AI systems instead of humans. It is unclear why consumers show this reaction, which we refer to as “algorithm discount.” To answer this question, we conducted a mixed-methods study in the context of digital news offerings, comprising 41 qualitative interviews and a choice-based conjoint analysis with 421 respondents. The results show that consumers’ beliefs about the love and effort imbued in the product, their curiosity about algorithmically generated products, and specific product characteristics, such as the type of news article, determine the algorithm discount. These findings extend our understanding of the emergence of consumers’ aversion to algorithm-created products and offer providers of such products insight into potential countermeasures."
