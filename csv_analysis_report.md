| JMIS      |   2025 | Orchestrating Digital Resilience: A Clinical IS Study of an Everything-as-a-Service Technology Strategy  | https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2435975 | Organisations must build digital resilience to effectively safeguard their business operations against environmental, economic, or socio-political disruptions. One approach involvesadaptation– using Information Technology (IT) to design business operations that can withstand and recover from such disruptions. A second approach involvesmitigation– using IT to advance environmental, social, or economic objectives that reduce the root causes and likelihood of future disruptions. However, both approaches to building digital resilience are challenging to implement. Our clinical Information Systems (IS) research article examines and reflects on how Beta Bank, an Australian fintech firm, developed an Everything-as-a-Service (EaaS) technology strategy and achieved digital resilience throughout its business operations. We explain how Beta Bank strategically leveraged EaaS to adapt to the significant disruptions caused by the Australian wildfire disaster and the global COVID pandemic of 2019–2021. We then unpack how Beta Bank further leveraged EaaS to enhance its digital resilience via a mitigation approach. Our work delineates a typology of four EaaS pathways for pursuing digital resilience, discusses the scholarly implications of EaaS as a future IS research area, and provides actionable managerial guidance through an EaaS roadmap, a strategic planning tool for those aiming to implement and benefit from this technology strategy. |
| JMIS      |   2025 | Responsible social media use: how user characteristics shape the actualisation of ambiguous affordances  | https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2444249 | Social media’s dual role as a source of both societal benefits and harms poses significant challenges to its responsible use. While existing literature primarily focuses on organisational and regulatory responsibilities, it sometimes overlooks individual user responsibility. This paper develops a theoretical framework that suggests user characteristics – specifically, conscientiousness and moral tolerance – are key moderators in the responsible (or irresponsible) actualisation of social media’s ambiguous affordances. Grounded in virtue ethics, the framework maintains that four archetypal user characters – narcissist, dogmatist, nihilist, and altruist – shape how social media affordances are actualised. Our work contributes to the Information Systems (IS) literature by adding a nuanced understanding of how responsible use shapes and is shaped by social media users and the sociotechnical context. The framework offers a basis for future research to examine the interaction between user characteristics, affordance ambiguity, and responsible social media use, underscoring the need for technocentric and sociocentric design interventions to promote responsible use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| JMIS      |   2025 | Data spaces as meta-organisations                                                                        | https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2025.2451250 | Sharing and reusing data across organisations is central to the European data strategy and its transformation towards creating a data-driven economy. Currently, data sharing, when it occurs, is typically facilitated through centralised platforms or bilateral integration solutions, which are increasingly failing to meet requirements for flexibility, trustworthiness, and self-determination over shared data. Data spaces have emerged as a promising solution, built on distributed and shared infrastructure and governance frameworks. However, widespread adoption requires consensus on the necessary organisational and technical capabilities. This paper proposes a data service model and design principles for data services to clarify choices and guide decision-making. We adopt a novel perspective by conceptualising data spaces as meta-organisations to guide an Action Design Research study, utilising privileged access to key large-scale European data space projects in the mobility and automotive sectors. This paper not only develops a nascent design theory for data spaces, but also offers a practical framework, breaking down complex challenges into actionable, scientifically validated components – for further growth and adoption of data spaces.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| JMIS      |   2025 | Designing an immersive virtual reality artefact for disability inclusion: an action design research      | https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2025.2460805 | People with disabilities (PWD) often face social barriers, such as inaccessible environments, public misunderstandings, and stereotypes, which lead to their exclusion from societal activities. To address this issue, we collaborated with a disability research institute to carry out an action design research (ADR) project aimed at designing an immersive virtual reality (IVR) artefact to cultivate public awareness of the social barriers faced by PWD and foster inclusive attitudes and behaviours towards them. Using technology affordance as a lens, this study went through four interwoven ADR stages to co-design and refine the IVR artefact with researchers, disability groups, IVR and media experts, and end users representing the public. Reflecting on this design process, we distilled our learnings into four design principles to prescribe what and how to craft IVR artefacts for fostering disability inclusion. These principles can guide researchers and practitioners in developing similar IVR artefacts to help address similar problems. Our co-design process, which involved PWDs, enhances the existing understanding and practice of socially inclusive design-oriented research by providing empirical evidence of working with marginalised groups in developing emerging technology artefacts.                                                                                                                                                      |
| JMIS      |   2025 | The Insider’s Dilemma: Employed Open Source Developers’ Identification Imbalance and Intentions to Leave | https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0960085X.2025.2463984 | In corporate-sponsored open source software development, company-employed developers become “insiders” to the OSS community, and therefore have two roles: they serve as a representative of their employing company, but may also identify as a member of the open source community. This study investigates what happens when identification with the company exceeds identification with the community (and vice versa), and also focuses on consequences when these insider roles come in conflict. Informed by social identity theory and organization-profession conflict theory, we report on two studies that predict identification imbalance to affect company turnover intention. Our first study is based on a survey of employed Linux kernel developers and uses polynomial regression to assess the effect of identification imbalance (and congruence) on company turnover intention. The second study extends our investigation beyond Linux and demonstrates that the effect of identification imbalance on turnover intention is mediated by role conflict. The findings suggest that turnover intention is lowest, when company and community identification match at high rather than low levels. We also find developers’ company career ambition influences how role conflict relates to company turnover intention. This study holds implications for theory and for managers in companies who engage with OSS communities.                                                  |

## 2. Main Research Variables
Based on the provided CSV data, here are the main research variables being studied in each paper, focusing on measurable concepts and attributes found in the abstracts.

### 1. Orchestrating Digital Resilience: A Clinical IS Study of an Everything-as-a-Service Technology Strategy

*   **Digital Resilience:** The primary outcome variable, defined as the ability to safeguard business operations against disruptions.
*   **Everything-as-a-Service (EaaS) Technology Strategy:** The main independent variable or intervention being studied.
*   **Adaptation and Mitigation Approaches:** Two distinct strategies or pathways for building resilience, treated as categorical variables.
*   **Business Operations:** An implied dependent variable, measuring the continuity and performance of the business.
*   **Environmental, Economic, or Socio-political Disruptions:** Contextual or independent variables (e.g., wildfires, pandemic) that trigger the need for resilience.

### 2. Responsible social media use: how user characteristics shape the actualisation of ambiguous affordances

*   **Responsible Social Media Use:** The main dependent variable, representing the positive or negative application of social media.
*   **User Characteristics:** The key independent/moderating variables, specifically:
    *   **Conscientiousness**
    *   **Moral Tolerance**
*   **Actualisation of Social Media Affordances:** A process or mediating variable describing how users enact the potential uses of a platform.
*   **User Archetypes:** A categorical variable derived from user characteristics (narcissist, dogmatist, nihilist, altruist).

### 3. Data spaces as meta-organisations

*   **Adoption and Growth of Data Spaces:** The primary dependent variable or outcome of interest.
*   **Data Sharing Attributes:** Key performance indicators or dependent variables that data spaces aim to improve, including:
    *   **Flexibility**
    *   **Trustworthiness**
    *   **Self-determination over data**
*   **Organisational and Technical Capabilities:** Independent variables or factors required for the successful implementation of data spaces.

### 4. Designing an immersive virtual reality artefact for disability inclusion: an action design research

## 3. Data Acquisition Difficulty
Of course. Here is an assessment of the potential data acquisition difficulty for each research variable, along with a brief explanation of the likely methodology.

### Data Acquisition Difficulty:

---

### 1. Orchestrating Digital Resilience: A Clinical IS Study of an Everything-as-a-Service Technology Strategy

*   **Digital Resilience:**
    *   **Difficulty: Difficult**
    *   **Explanation:** This is a complex, multifaceted outcome. Measuring it requires access to sensitive, longitudinal internal company data, such as system uptime, recovery times, financial losses during disruptions, and operational performance metrics. It cannot be found in public records and requires deep, trust-based access to an organisation.

*   **Everything-as-a-Service (EaaS) Technology Strategy:**
    *   **Difficulty: Moderate**
    *   **Explanation:** This variable can be identified through interviews with key personnel (e.g., CIOs, IT managers) or by analysing company documentation and technology architecture. It is not publicly available data but is a concrete attribute that can be determined within a case study or survey context.

*   **Adaptation and Mitigation Approaches:**
    *   **Difficulty: Moderate**
    *   **Explanation:** This requires qualitative data from interviews, workshops, or analysis of internal company reports to understand and categorise the specific actions a company took. It is context-dependent and requires direct engagement with the research subjects.

*   **Business Operations:**
    *   **Difficulty: Difficult**
    *   **Explanation:** Similar to Digital Resilience, this involves sensitive, proprietary company performance metrics (e.g., revenue, customer satisfaction, supply chain efficiency). Gaining access to this data at a granular level is challenging and depends entirely on the cooperation of the participating organisation.

*   **Environmental, Economic, or Socio-political Disruptions:**
    *   **Difficulty: Easy**
    *   **Explanation:** Data on the occurrence and scale of major events like pandemics, wildfires, or economic recessions is publicly available through government agencies, news archives, and public databases. The challenge is not in acquiring data on the event, but in linking it to organisational outcomes.

---

### 2. Responsible social media use: how user characteristics shape the actualisation of ambiguous affordances

*   **Responsible Social Media Use:**
    *   **Difficulty: Moderate**
    *   **Explanation:** This is a behavioural and ethical construct. Data acquisition would require a validated survey instrument to capture self-reported behaviours or qualitative analysis of user-generated content, which raises ethical and privacy concerns. It is not directly observable on a large scale.

*   **User Characteristics (Conscientiousness, Moral Tolerance):**
    *   **Difficulty: Moderate**
    *   **Explanation:** These are standard psychological traits. Data must be collected by administering established psychometric surveys (e.g., Big Five personality inventory) to a sample of users. This requires effort in participant recruitment and survey administration but uses well-known methods.

*   **Actualisation of Social Media Affordances:**
    *   **Difficulty: Difficult**
    *   **Explanation:** This is an abstract, process-oriented variable. Measuring *how* users enact the potential uses of a platform is complex and would likely require a mixed-methods approach, such as combining surveys with in-depth interviews, user diaries, or direct observation in a lab setting.

*   **User Archetypes:**
    *   **Difficulty: Moderate**
    *   **Explanation:** This is a derived variable, created by analysing the primary data on user characteristics. The difficulty is not in acquiring data for the archetypes themselves, but in collecting the underlying user characteristic data through surveys.

---

### 3. Data spaces as meta-organisations

*   **Adoption and Growth of Data Spaces:**
    *   **Difficulty: Difficult**
    *   **Explanation:** This requires access to proprietary operational data from multiple, independent "data space" operators. Metrics like the number of participating organisations, data transaction volume, and growth rates are not typically public. It would necessitate cooperation from the governing bodies of these data spaces.

*   **Data Sharing Attributes (Flexibility, Trustworthiness, Self-determination):**
    *   **Difficulty: Moderate**
    *   **Explanation:** These are perceptual variables. Data can be collected by designing and administering surveys to the individuals or organisations participating within the data spaces. It relies on subjective feedback rather than objective, public data.

*   **Organisational and Technical Capabilities:**
    *   **Difficulty: Moderate**
    *   **Explanation:** This data can be assessed through surveys or interviews with key personnel in participating organisations, focusing on their IT infrastructure, data governance policies, and employee skill sets. It requires access to organisations but is based on relatively standard business assessment questions.

---

### 4. Designing an immersive virtual reality artefact for disability inclusion: an action design research

*   **Use of an Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) Artefact:**
    *   **Difficulty: Easy**
    *   **Explanation:** This is the intervention in a controlled experiment. The data (i.e., who used the artefact and how) is generated and directly controlled by the research design itself.

*   **Public Awareness, Inclusive Attitudes, Inclusive Behaviours:**
    *   **Difficulty: Moderate**
    *   **Explanation:** These are classic psychological and behavioural outcomes. Data would be collected in an experimental setup, typically using pre- and post-intervention surveys for awareness and attitudes, and controlled behavioural observation or simulations for behaviours.

*   **Disability Inclusion:**
    *   **Difficulty: Difficult**
    *   **Explanation:** This is a broad, societal-level concept that is very hard to measure directly from a single intervention. Researchers would likely use the other dependent variables (awareness, attitudes, behaviours) as more measurable proxies for this larger goal. Acquiring direct, macro-level data on "inclusion" is beyond the scope of a typical experimental study.

---

### 5. The Insider’s Dilemma: Employed Open Source Developers’ Identification Imbalance and Intentions to Leave

*   **Identification Imbalance:**
    *   **Difficulty: Moderate**
    *   **Explanation:** This psychological construct requires a survey with validated scales to measure a developer's identification with their company and, separately, with the open-source community. The "imbalance" is then calculated from these two measures.

*   **Company Turnover Intention:**
    *   **Difficulty: Moderate**
    *   **Explanation:** This is a standard construct in organisational research. Data is readily acquired using well-established and validated survey scales administered to the target population (in this case, employed developers).

*   **Role Conflict:**
    *   **Difficulty: Moderate**
    *   **Explanation:** Like turnover intention, this is a standard organisational psychology construct. It can be measured effectively using existing, validated survey instruments.

*   **Company Career Ambition:**
    *   **Difficulty: Moderate**
    *   **Explanation:** This is a personal, psychological trait that can also be measured using established psychometric scales administered through a survey to the target population.

## 4. Data Processing Methods and Costs
Of course. Here is a detailed breakdown of potential data processing methods and their associated costs for each set of research variables. The analysis assumes typical data acquisition methods based on the nature of the variables described.

---

### General Cost Estimation Framework

*   **Computational Resources:** Refers to CPU time, RAM, and storage.
    *   **Low:** Can be run on a standard laptop with basic software (e.g., Excel, R/Python with small datasets).
    *   **Medium:** May require a more powerful workstation or take several hours to run; larger datasets or more complex models (e.g., basic machine learning, SEM on large samples).
    *   **High:** Requires dedicated servers, cloud computing (e.g., AWS, Azure), or parallel processing; very large datasets (big data) or computationally intensive simulations.
*   **Manual Effort:** Measured in person-hours or Full-Time Equivalents (FTEs).
    *   **Low:** A few hours of work; tasks are straightforward and can be automated easily.
    *   **Medium:** Several days to weeks of work; requires careful checking, data cleaning, and thoughtful analysis setup.
    *   **High:** Weeks to months of work; involves extensive manual tasks like transcription, coding qualitative data, or complex data merging from disparate sources.
*   **Specialized Software:** Refers to the need for licensed software beyond standard office suites or free open-source tools.
    *   **Low:** Can be done entirely with free tools (R, Python, PSPP) or basic software (Excel).
    *   **Medium:** Benefits from but doesn't strictly require paid software (e.g., SPSS, Stata, Tableau).
    *   **High:** Requires specialized, often expensive, licensed software (e.g., NVivo for qualitative analysis, Mplus for advanced SEM, specialized simulation tools).

### 1. Orchestrating Digital Resilience: A Clinical IS Study of an Everything-as-a-Service Technology Strategy

**Potential Data Acquisition Methods:** This is described as a "Clinical IS Study," which strongly suggests qualitative methods like semi-structured interviews with key personnel, analysis of internal documents (incident reports, strategy documents), and direct observation. It might be supplemented with quantitative operational data (e.g., system downtime, recovery times).

| Data Processing Step | Description & Methods | Cost Estimation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Cleaning** | **Qualitative:** Transcribing interviews, anonymizing names and sensitive company data. Correcting transcription errors. <br> **Quantitative:** Identifying and handling missing operational data (e.g., downtime logs). Flagging outliers that may be due to planned maintenance vs. actual disruptions. | **Computational:** Low <br> **Manual Effort:** High (Transcription is very time-consuming, ~4-6 hours per hour of audio). <br> **Software:** Medium (Transcription services like Otter.ai or Rev have costs; manual work is an alternative). |
| **Data Transformation** | **Qualitative:** No transformation in the traditional sense. The key step is data reduction through coding. <br> **Quantitative:** Creating standardized metrics (e.g., percentage of uptime). Categorizing disruption events (e.g., environmental, technical, socio-political). | **Computational:** Low <br> **Manual Effort:** Medium (Requires careful thought to define categories and metrics). <br> **Software:** Low. |
| **Aggregation & Feature Engineering** | **Qualitative:** Developing themes from codes. Aggregating codes to identify patterns related to "Adaptation" vs. "Mitigation" approaches. <br> **Quantitative:** Aggregating incident data by month or quarter to show trends. Calculating mean-time-to-recovery (MTTR) before and after the EaaS strategy was implemented. | **Computational:** Low <br> **Manual Effort:** High (Thematic analysis is intellectually intensive and requires significant researcher time and consensus-building). <br> **Software:** High (Requires qualitative data analysis software like NVivo or MAXQDA for efficient coding and theme development). |
| **Statistical Analysis** | **Qualitative:** Thematic analysis, narrative analysis, and case study comparison to build a theoretical model explaining how EaaS contributes to digital resilience. <br> **Quantitative:** Descriptive statistics, paired-samples t-tests or ANOVA to compare operational metrics before and after the EaaS implementation. | **Computational:** Low <br> **Manual Effort:** High (Qualitative analysis) / Low (Quantitative analysis). <br> **Software:** High (NVivo) / Low (R, SPSS). |

### 2. Responsible social media use: how user characteristics shape the actualisation of ambiguous affordances

**Potential Data Acquisition Methods:** The variables (Conscientiousness, Moral Tolerance, User Archetypes) strongly suggest quantitative survey-based methods using validated psychometric scales (e.g., Likert-type questions).

| Data Processing Step | Description & Methods | Cost Estimation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Cleaning** | Checking for incomplete survey responses, identifying and removing "straight-lining" (where a user gives the same answer to all questions). Verifying data entry. | **Computational:** Low <br> **Manual Effort:** Medium (Requires careful review of raw data and decision-making on how to handle problematic responses). <br> **Software:** Low (Can be done in Excel or with simple scripts in R/Python). |
| **Data Transformation** | Reverse-scoring negatively worded items in the psychological scales. Calculating composite scores for variables like "Conscientiousness" by averaging the responses to its corresponding items. Encoding "User Archetypes" into numerical categories for analysis. | **Computational:** Low <br> **Manual Effort:** Low (Once the rules are set, the process is highly automatable). <br> **Software:** Low (R, Python, SPSS). |
| **Aggregation & Feature Engineering** | The main step is creating the composite scores mentioned above. Deriving the "User Archetypes" might involve cluster analysis on the user characteristic variables to empirically group users. | **Computational:** Low-Medium (Cluster analysis can be slightly more intensive but is standard). <br> **Manual Effort:** Medium (Requires expertise to select the right clustering method and interpret the resulting clusters). <br> **Software:** Medium (SPSS or Stata are common; R/Python are free alternatives). |
| **Statistical Analysis** | **Descriptive:** Means, standard deviations for all scales. <br> **Inferential:** Correlation analysis to see relationships between variables. Multiple regression to predict "Responsible Social Media Use" from "User Characteristics." ANOVA to compare responsible use across different "User Archetypes." | **Computational:** Low <br> **Manual Effort:** Medium (Requires knowledge of statistics to choose, run, and interpret the correct tests). <br> **Software:** Medium (SPSS, Stata) or Low (R, Python). |

### 3. Data spaces as meta-organisations

**Potential Data Acquisition Methods:** This research likely uses a mixed-methods approach.

**Potential Data Acquisition Methods:** This is an experimental or quasi-experimental study. Data would be collected via pre- and post-test surveys measuring "Public Awareness," "Inclusive Attitudes," and "Inclusive Behaviours" from participants who used the IVR artifact (and possibly a control group).

| Data Processing Step | Description & Methods | Cost Estimation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Cleaning** | Matching pre-test and post-test data for each participant using a unique identifier. Handling participant dropout (attrition). Checking for data entry errors. | **Computational:** Low <br> **Manual Effort:** Medium (Managing participant data requires careful organization). <br> **Software:** Low. |
| **Data Transformation** | Creating composite scores for multi-item scales (e.g., "Inclusive Attitudes Scale").

### 5. The Insider’s Dilemma: Employed Open Source Developers’ Identification Imbalance and Intentions to Leave

**Potential Data Acquisition Methods:** This is a classic organizational psychology study using surveys with validated scales to measure all variables: Identification (with company and community), Role Conflict, Company Career Ambition, and Company Turnover Intention.

| Data Processing Step | Description & Methods | Cost Estimation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Cleaning** | Standard survey data cleaning: checking for missing values, outliers, and response patterns. Ensuring confidentiality of responses. | **Computational:** Low <br> **Manual Effort:** Medium <br> **Software:** Low |
| **Data Transformation** | Calculating composite scores for each scale by averaging item responses. The key step here is calculating the **Identification Imbalance** variable, likely as `Community_ID_Score - Company_ID_Score`. This is a critical transformation step. | **Computational:** Low <br> **Manual Effort:** Low <br> **Software:** Low |
| **Aggregation & Feature Engineering** | The main feature engineering is the creation of the "Identification Imbalance" score. No major aggregation is likely needed as the analysis is at the individual developer level. | **Computational:** Low <br> **Manual Effort:** Low <br> **Software:** Low |
| **Statistical Analysis** | The variable structure (independent -> mediating -> dependent, with a moderator) points directly to a **moderated mediation analysis**. This tests whether the indirect effect of "Identification Imbalance" on "Turnover Intention" (through "Role Conflict") is conditional on "Company Career Ambition." This is typically done using tools like the PROCESS macro for SPSS or packages like `lavaan` in R. | **Computational:** Low-Medium <br> **Manual Effort:** High (Setting up, running, and interpreting moderated mediation models requires significant statistical expertise). <br> **Software:** Medium (The PROCESS macro is free, but requires a licensed copy of SPSS. R is a free alternative but has a steeper learning curve). |

## 5. Relevant Theories
Of course. Based on the provided research variables, here are relevant theoretical perspectives and existing theories from Information Systems, Social Sciences, and Management that could explain the research problem and potential results for each study.

### **1. Orchestrating Digital Resilience: A Clinical IS Study of an Everything-as-a-Service Technology Strategy**

This study examines how a specific technology strategy (EaaS) enables organizations to adapt and maintain operations during major disruptions. The core concepts are resilience, adaptation, and technology's role as an enabler.

*   **Dynamic Capabilities View (DCV):** A prominent theory in strategic management, DCV argues that competitive advantage in volatile environments comes from a firm's ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competencies.
    *   **Relevance:** EaaS can be framed as a technological foundation for **dynamic capabilities**. It allows a firm to rapidly scale, reconfigure, and deploy resources (the "adaptation and mitigation approaches") in response to "environmental disruptions." Digital resilience, in this context, is the outcome of well-executed dynamic capabilities enabled by the EaaS strategy.

*   **Organizational Resilience Theory:** This theory focuses specifically on how organizations anticipate, cope with, and adapt to adversity and unexpected shocks to not only survive but also emerge stronger.
    *   **Relevance:** This is a direct fit. The study's main variable, "Digital Resilience," is the central construct of this theory. The theory would help explain *how* the "adaptation and mitigation" pathways, supported by EaaS, contribute to the different phases of resilience: robustness (withstanding the shock), agility (responding quickly), and adaptive capacity (learning and changing).

*   **Sociotechnical Systems (STS) Theory:** An older but foundational IS theory, STS posits that organizational performance is optimized by jointly optimizing both the social and technical systems. A technology change is never just a technical change; it impacts people, processes, and structures.
    *   **Relevance:** Implementing an "EaaS Technology Strategy" is a major sociotechnical intervention. This theory would help explain why its success in building resilience depends not just on the technology itself, but on how it is integrated with "business operations," employee skills, and organizational culture. It highlights that resilience is an emergent property of the entire system, not just the technology.

### **2. Responsible social media use: how user characteristics shape the actualisation of ambiguous affordances**

This research investigates the interplay between individual personality, the potential uses of social media (affordances), and the resulting ethical or unethical behavior.

*   **Theory of Affordances:** Originating in psychology and heavily adopted by IS, this theory states that objects and technologies have "affordances"—potentialities for action that users may or may not perceive and act upon ("actualise").
    *   **Relevance:** This theory is central to the study, as "Actualisation of Social Media Affordances" is a key variable. It provides the mechanism linking the technology to the user. The theory would suggest that social media platforms have ambiguous affordances (e.g., an affordance for connection can be actualized for support or for harassment). The study's results would demonstrate how "user characteristics" determine which of these potential actions are perceived and enacted.

*   **The Big Five Personality Traits (Five-Factor Model):** A dominant model in psychology that describes personality across five dimensions: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism.
    *   **Relevance:** The study explicitly uses "Conscientiousness" as an independent variable. This model provides the theoretical grounding for why stable personality traits can predict behavior. The theory would predict that individuals high in conscientiousness (disciplined, dutiful) are more likely to actualize affordances in a way that aligns with "Responsible Social Media Use," while those low on this trait might be more impulsive or irresponsible.

*   **Uses and Gratifications Theory (UGT):** A communications theory that focuses on *why* people actively seek out specific media to satisfy specific needs. It shifts the focus from "what media does to people" to "what people do with media."
    *   **Relevance:** UGT would explain the motivation behind *how* users choose to actualize affordances. A user's "moral tolerance" and "conscientiousness" would shape the gratifications they seek from social media (e.g., social connection, validation, information, or conflict). The "user archetypes" (narcissist, altruist) could be explained as profiles of users seeking different sets of gratifications, leading to vastly different patterns of "responsible" or irresponsible use.

### **3. Data spaces as meta-organisations**

This study focuses on the adoption and performance of data spaces, which are inter-organizational systems for data sharing. The key concepts are trust, collaboration, and overcoming data-sharing barriers.

*   **Transaction Cost Economics (TCE):** This economic theory explains why firms exist and how they structure themselves (e.g., markets vs. hierarchies). It argues that organizations choose governance structures that minimize the costs of transacting.
    *   **Relevance:** Data spaces can be analyzed as a governance mechanism ("meta-organisation") designed to reduce the transaction costs of data sharing, such as the costs of finding partners, negotiating agreements, and monitoring compliance. The variables "Trustworthiness" and "Flexibility" directly address key sources of transaction costs (opportunism and uncertainty). TCE would predict that data spaces will be adopted when they are more efficient than one-to-one data sharing agreements or open data markets.

*   **Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) Framework:** A widely used IS framework for studying technology adoption at the organizational level. It posits that adoption is influenced by the technological context (the technology's characteristics), the organizational context (firm size, capabilities), and the environmental context (industry pressure, regulation).
    *   **Relevance:** This framework provides a comprehensive model to explain the "Adoption and Growth of Data Spaces." The "Organisational and Technical Capabilities" are a direct fit for the T and O components. The desire for "Self-determination over data" could be an environmental pressure (e.g., driven by regulations like GDPR) or an organizational goal.

*   **Resource-Based View (RBV) of the Firm:** A management theory suggesting that firms gain competitive advantage from possessing valuable, rare, inimitable, and non-substitutable (VRIN) resources and capabilities.
    *   **Relevance:** From an RBV perspective, data is a strategic resource. A firm would join a data space to access complementary data resources from other organizations that it cannot generate on its own, thereby creating a more valuable, combined resource pool. The "Organisational and Technical Capabilities" required to participate effectively in a data space could themselves be considered a valuable capability.

### **4. Designing an immersive virtual reality artefact for disability inclusion: an action design research**

This study explores how a technological intervention (VR) can be used to change attitudes and behaviors related to a social issue.

*   **Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB):** A social psychology theory that is one of the most powerful predictors of human behavior. It posits that behavioral intention (the precursor to behavior) is determined by three factors: one's attitude toward the behavior, subjective norms (social pressure), and perceived behavioral control (ease or difficulty of performing the behavior).
    *   **Relevance:** This theory directly maps onto the study's variables. The VR artefact is designed to primarily influence "Inclusive Attitudes." By simulating the challenges faced by PWD, it might also increase perceived behavioral control (e.g., by showing *how* to be more inclusive) and influence subjective norms (by making inclusivity seem more socially desirable). The ultimate goal is to foster "Inclusive Behaviours," which TPB links directly to these antecedents.

*   **Experiential Learning Theory (Kolb):** This theory proposes that learning is a process where knowledge is created through the transformation of experience. It involves a cycle of concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, and active experimentation.
    *   **Relevance:** The "Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) Artefact" provides the **concrete experience** of navigating the world with a disability. This experience is designed to trigger **reflective observation** in the user, leading to new understanding (**abstract conceptualization**) about social barriers and disability. The desired outcome, "Inclusive Behaviours," represents the **active experimentation** phase, where the user applies their new understanding in the real world.

*   **Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM):** A theory of persuasion that describes how attitudes are formed and changed. It suggests two routes to persuasion: the central route (based on careful, logical consideration of arguments) and the peripheral route (based on emotional or surface-level cues).
    *   **Relevance:** VR is a powerful persuasive tool that engages both routes. The experience can provide factual information (central route) while simultaneously generating strong emotional responses like empathy (peripheral route). ELM would predict that the resulting change in "Inclusive Attitudes" will be more robust and long-lasting because it was formed through both cognitive and affective engagement.

### **5. The Insider’s Dilemma: Employed Open Source Developers’ Identification Imbalance and Intentions to Leave**

This research delves into the identity conflicts faced by employees who are also active members of an external professional community, and how this conflict affects their loyalty to their employer.

*   **Social Identity Theory (SIT):** A foundational social psychology theory that explains group behavior based on the idea that individuals derive a part of their self-concept from their membership in social groups. People are motivated to maintain a positive identity by favorably comparing their in-group to out-groups.
    *   **Relevance:** This is the core theoretical lens for this study. The "Insider's Dilemma" is a classic social identity problem. The developer has two salient in-groups: their company and the open-source community. The "Identification Imbalance" variable is a direct measure of the relative strength of these two social identities. SIT would predict that when identification with the external community is stronger and conflicts with the company's goals or values, it creates psychological discomfort that can lead to distancing from the company, culminating in "Company Turnover Intention."

*   **Role Conflict Theory:** This theory from organizational behavior describes the stress experienced by an individual who faces incompatible demands from two or more roles they hold.
    *   **Relevance:** This theory is explicitly named as the study's mediator. The developer occupies the "employee" role and the "open-source community member" role. Conflict arises when the norms, values, and expectations of these two roles clash (e.g., company demands secrecy while the community values transparency). This "Role Conflict" is the psychological mechanism that explains *why* an "Identification Imbalance" leads to negative outcomes like the desire to leave.

*   **Job Embeddedness Theory:** A theory of employee retention that focuses on the forces that keep an employee in their job. It consists of three dimensions: Links (connections to people and activities), Fit (perceived compatibility with the job/organization), and Sacrifice (the perceived costs of leaving).
    *   **Relevance:** This theory provides a complementary explanation for turnover. A strong identification with the open-source community can weaken an employee's embeddedness. It creates strong "Links" outside the company and can reduce the perceived "Fit" with the company's culture or goals. The moderator "Company Career Ambition" directly relates to the "Sacrifice" dimension—an ambitious developer perceives a higher cost of leaving, which would embed them more strongly and potentially buffer the negative effects of role conflict.
